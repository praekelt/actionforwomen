<title>Month one, week 1</title>
<body>Amazing developments are taking place inside you. Your baby's just about the size of a poppy seed. The placenta and umbilical cord, which bring nourishment and oxygen to your baby, are already working. 
You need to take good care of yourself now you're pregnant. Go to the clinic for regular check ups 
during pregnancy. 
You need to start taking a daily folic acid tablet. Folic acid helps protect your baby against spinal and brain problems. The clinic will tell you how much folic acid you need.

<title>Month one, week 2</title>
<body>Your baby is growing rapidly. His heart has begun to beat. Your baby's kidneys and heart are growing, and his spine is developing. 
You may just start to notice some tell-tale signs that you're expecting. You may feel queasy, or find that you go off certain foods. This is very common in early pregnancy. 
You may feel overwhelmed by tiredness, and unable to do anything but collapse at the end of the day. Tender breasts and the urge to urinate often are also early signs you are pregnant. You may get more headaches in the first trimester too. 
Although you may find these early symptoms annoying, they won't last long.

<body>Your baby is about the size of a small bean. Although she's tiny, her eyes, nostrils and ears are just starting to form. Her arms and legs look like protruding buds. 
Your body is transforming too and it can leave you feeling tired. You may even be feeling low. It's especially hard if you have not yet told your friends and family that you're pregnant. 
You may find it difficult to sleep. This may be because of those extra trips to the toilet throughout the night, or you can't get comfortable because of your sore breasts, or you wake up in need of a midnight snack.  Try to rest as often as you can. Arrange to go to the clinic if you have not been yet.

Always check at the clinic if you're having cramps, particularly if you are bleeding as well. 
It's normal to feel emotional. You may feel ecstatic one moment and in tears the next. It's common to have such mood swings, and is usually because of a combination of surging hormones and worries about pregnancy and parenthood.

 Pregnancy hormones tend to play havoc with your body in all sorts of ways. Headaches and backache are both common if you're expecting. They can also help to create the perfect environment for vaginal thrush.
Worried about whether it's safe to have sex? For the vast majority of women it's perfectly safe to enjoy a fulfilling sex life throughout your pregnancy.

<body>Your baby is now fully formed, from tooth buds to toenails. But he measures just about the length of your thumb. 
 It's common to leak a little urine when you sneeze or laugh during pregnancy. Your hormones cause your pelvic floor muscles to weaken .If your pelvic floor muscles are weak, you may leak urine if you laugh, cough, sneeze or run. 
Regular pelvic floor exercises will strengthen the muscles that control your bladder and prevent leaks. Try to stop the flow when you urinate. This will help you feel your pelvic floor muscles. Try to squeeze those muscles several times a day to keep them strong.

A heavier discharge and the urge to urinate more often are normal pregnancy symptoms. But these could also be symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Go to your clinic if you have trouble emptying your bladder, if it stings when you urinate and you have a fever.

You may see a slight increase in your blood pressure, which is normal. Your clinic will want to check that you don't develop pre-eclampsia. This is linked to high blood pressure. 
Your clinic will check for protein in your urine, which is another   sign of pre-eclampsia.
Other symptoms include severe headaches, blurred vision and swollen hands and feet. Go to your clinic if you notice any of these symptoms.

Your body is altering rapidly now. Your womb is up near your rib cage and you may discover the delights of leg cramps or swollen veins. You breasts will be fuller and heavier as they get ready to make milk for your baby.  The milk in your breasts at the beginning of a feed is quite watery and high in sugar. It refreshes your baby and gives him a quick boost, so he has the energy to go on feeding. Then your milk becomes much richer, with more fat in it. This milk helps your baby grow.
You will have another antenatal check up soon at your clinic.

You may find that your appetite is increasing. It's tempting to fill up on cakes, sweets and fast food snacks, but try to keep these as treats. Snacking on fruit and bread will give you far more energy. 
Choosing your baby's name is a fun part of pregnancy. The rest of your family may want to join in as well.  You may have a family name you are sure you want to choose. Or you may have several names you like and find it hard to choose just one or two. Make a short list, keep them all in mind and make the final decision when you meet your baby.

<body>Your baby will settle into a head down position inside you. His head will be born first, so he turns upside down ready for labour to begin. 
You may feel a little breathless during these last few weeks. This is because your womb is pressing up against your diaphragm, the muscle across your middle that helps you to breathe. 
You may also start to feel some hip pain. The stretchy tissues holding your hips to your pelvis may get very loose. This is your body preparing for labour. If it feels uncomfortable try kneeling on your hands and knees. This takes the weight of your baby off your pelvis and holds it in a stable position.

You might feel the baby's head low down between your legs. You may get some swelling there as well. Rest lying down, with your feet on a pillow when you can, to ease the swelling. 
If you have practice contractions or just get aches and pains you can use them to practice for labour. See if you can find a comfortable position. Kneel on the floor, or use cushions to prop yourself up in bed.  Or stand and lean over a table or chair. Then breathe deeply and steadily and try to relax your body. This will help you practice for labour.

<body>Your baby is swallowing the amniotic fluid and then passing it out again. Her internal organs are all working now, and her gut is lined with a black sticky substance that will be her first poo. 
You may notice that your feet, hands, face, and ankles have become a bit swollen. This is normal. It is just your body holding water.  It may be worse in warm weather and later in the day. But, if the swelling's severe, and you have headaches, go straight to the clinic. These are signs of pre-eclampsia.
To start preparing yourself for the birth, make sure you know how to contact your family and your blood donors. If you have older children, arrange for someone to take care of them.

<body>Your baby's lungs are working and babies born at this stage may be a little early but they are usually perfectly healthy. 
 If your waters break, or you start having regular contractions, it is time to get ready to go to the clinic. 
Your waters will be clear with a yellow tinge or a bit of blood. It may gush or leak. Contractions will get stronger over time and will be painful. If you spot these signs, find the fastest way to get to the clinic.

<title>Month eight, week 4</title>
<body>You may notice your baby moving a little less. This is because he is snugly fitted in your womb. He also has fully grown fingernails and toenails. His kidneys are fully grown too. 
 You may be feel that you've run out of room - your womb has grown to 1,000 times its original size. 
Often in early labour contractions come and go. One minute you may think you are in labour and the next you are not so sure.  Have a good walk around. The rocking movement can help get things going. Make sure you have something to eat and drink to give you some energy. If it is nighttime try having a warm bath or shower to help you relax. Once your contractions become regular and start getting stronger,  go to the clinic.

<body>Your baby can be born any day now. Although it's a tight squeeze in there, your baby is still busily growing. Her hair and fingernails will be getting longer too. 
It can be frustrating waiting for your baby to arrive. But you won't be considered overdue just yet. 
With labour close you can start looking out for signs. A gush or trickle of water, contractions that become stronger and more painful and a bloodied mucus discharge are all keys signs. 
Make sure you know the best route to the hospital for when you spot them!

<body>Your baby is shedding the fine hair he grew in the middle of pregnancy. He is also losing the protective waxy coating on his skin which protected him while he was floating in the waters inside you. He may still have traces of this on him when he's born in the skin folds around his shoulders. 
Your baby swallows anything he sheds and these will stay in his bowels until birth. His first stool will be a blackish mixture, called meconium. 
You will have a check up soon. Tell the clinic about any new symptoms you have.

<body>It may seem as though you have been pregnant forever. You may be desperate to have your baby now. Friends and family are probably giving you a lot of advice. Herbs and traditional remedies are not safe, but there are natural things you can try to get your labour moving.
Try some spicy food? Some mums say that this helped to start their labour. Try cooking up a hot curry for yourself and see if it works.
While you are waiting, you and your partner could try a little love-making. Sex can help your cervix soften and get labour going. And if it doesn't at least you had fun trying!

<title>Can I be pregnant and still have periods?</title>
<body>No, not really. Once your body starts producing the pregnancy hormone, your normal periods will stop.
But, bleeding in early pregnancy is very common. You may have what looks like a period. This is known as breakthrough bleeding. It happens when the hormones that control your periods break through the pregnancy hormones in your body. 
Bleeding may also happen when the baby implants into your womb. This usually happens at about the time your period would have been due. 
Pregnancy hormones can also soften the neck of your womb. This may mean that you have a little bleeding after sex. This is not unusual.
Although bleeding in pregnancy is very common, some signs mean that there is a problem. If you have bleeding and pain, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to find out what's wrong:

<title>Do I need to eat more now I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>Your appetite is your best guide of how much you need to eat. You may find it varies.
In the first few weeks you may not feel like eating proper meals, especially if you are feeling sick. Try eating cold food, which does not smell as strongly, and sipping cool drinks between meals. You might find it easier to just eat what you fancy.
Later in your pregnancy your appetite may be the same as before you were pregnant or slightly increased. You only need a bit more food than usual.
Towards the end, your appetite will probably increase. If you get heartburn or a full feeling after eating you may find it helps to have small, frequent meals.
The best rule to remember is to eat when you are hungry. Have a good balance of foods and you will gain weight as your baby grows.

<title>Why do I feel sick?</title>
<body>Feeling sick is an uncomfortable part of being pregnant, but it is very common. 
How bad you feel varies from woman to woman. You may just feel a bit sick when you first wake up, or certain smells might make you feel sick all day. You may find you are feeling or being sick for weeks or months. If you are expecting twins, it may be worse.
If you get it badly you might find it hard to carry on with normal life. You may worry that you should be feeling happy about your pregnancy and not sad and ill. You may feel that nobody understands. Talk to your family and friends about how you feel.
Pregnancy sickness is normal, but if you're vomiting many times a day, unable to eat and drink without being sick and losing weight, you may need treatment at the clinic.

<title>I missed a period - am I pregnant?</title>
<body>A missed period is one of the surest signs of pregnancy.  But, this sign is only easy to spot if your period is usually regular.  A late or missed period is more obvious if you know when to expect it. If this is the case for you, it is best to go to the clinic for a checkup now. The staff there will be able to confirm if you are pregnant. 
But, if your periods are irregular or you have lost track of when your next one was due, you won't realise your period is late. In this case it is best to look out for other signs of pregnancy. Tender breasts, feeling sick and needing to pass water more often are good clues to look out for.  If you spot them, head to the clinic to find out for sure. If you have none of these symptoms but think you might have missed two periods, go to the clinic anyway.

<title>Iron</title>
<body>Iron helps us to carry oxygen around our body. During pregnancy you need a lot of extra iron. Without enough iron your body won't get as much oxygen. This is called iron-deficiency anaemia. This is the most common type of anaemia in pregnancy. It will make you feel tired and weak.
Make sure you eat plenty of iron-rich foods. There are two sorts of iron-rich foods. Red meat, fish and poultry contain iron that easy for your body to use. Foods such as lentils, beans, dried fruit and green leafy vegetables contain a different sort of iron. This is harder for your body to take in. To get enough iron, try to have a mixture of all these foods.
Try not to drink tea or coffee with meals, as these make it harder for your body to absorb iron.
You can also help yourself get enough iron by taking your daily iron pill. Take this with some fruit juice. This will help your body take in more of the iron.

<title>Is it safe to eat meat now I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>Meat is a great source of protein. All fresh meat is fine to eat when it is well cooked. Make sure you cook meat really well, until there are no pink bits in the middle and the juices run clear.
You can get sick from eating undercooked meat. This won't harm your baby, but it can make you very unwell. When you're pregnant you're more likely to get sick because your body is protecting your baby.
It's best not to eat cured meats. They carry a risk of infection.
Germs from food can give you severe sickness and diarrhoea, tummy pain, a headache, and a high fever.
If you feel like this, drink lots of clean water. Try a little cooked food like potato or porridge. If you don't feel better after a few days, do go to the clinic. The staff will be able to help you.

<title>Can I have sex while I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>Yes you can! If you have a normal pregnancy, you can keep doing it right up until your waters break.
If you feel like having sex, go ahead. Having happy sex during your pregnancy is good for you and your partner.
You might worry that sex might make you miscarry your baby. But for most couples there is no danger. If you have had bleeding in this pregnancy, or previous miscarriages, you may want to avoid sex for the first 3 months of pregnancy. 
To help prevent any infections, it is best if your partner wears a condom. This way you will be able to stay healthy. If you do get an infection - go to the clinic. They will be able to treat you.
Having sex won't make you go into labour early, but it can help get labour going if you are overdue.

<title>What is an ectopic pregnancy?</title>
<body>Ectopic means 'in the wrong place'. It happens when a pregnancy develops outside of your womb.
Most ectopic pregnancies happen in one of the fallopian tubes. This is why it's also known as a tubal pregnancy. As your pregnancy grows, it causes pain and bleeding. If it's not treated, the tube can break and cause bleeding.
An ectopic pregnancy is most likely to happen in the first three months of your pregnancy. Most women see signs about two weeks after they miss a period. 
Doctors don't really know why an ectopic pregnancy happens, but it could be due to the tube being scarred or too narrow.
Sadly, if you have an ectopic pregnancy it cannot be saved. You will need quick treatment to stay safe.
If you think this is happening to you, go straight to the clinic. The staff there will be able to give you the treatment you need.

<title>Go to the clinic as soon as you have missed your period</title>
<body>Some women want to keep their pregnancy a secret to experience the first weeks by themselves. Other women don't want to tell because they fear it will bring bad luck. 
But going to the clinic for early care doesn't mean you have to tell everyone else. And it doesn't bring bad luck. 
In fact, talking about being pregnant at the clinic will be good for you and your baby. It will mean fewer problems if you get the right care early on. Testing for HIV early means you can have the right medication and it's free. Taking the right tests and medicines can prevent your baby from becoming HIV+. 
Go to the clinic as soon as you're a sure you have missed one or two periods. You can go back to the clinic for regular health checks afterwards. You will need at least four check-ups during your pregnancy.

<title>Why do I need to take folic acid tablets?</title>
<body>Folic acid is a B vitamin. It is found in peas and beans, green vegetables, some fruit, and yeast and beef extracts. It's called folate in foods.
Folic acid helps to prevent defects in your baby's nerve system, like spina bifida. Spina bifida happens when the protective covering that grows round an unborn baby's spinal cord doesn't close properly. This can lead to permanent nerve damage.
Your baby's brain and nerve system form and grow fast in the first three months. That's why it's important to take daily folic acid tablets. You can keep taking them throughout your pregnancy to give you an extra boost.
You will be given folic acid tablets at the clinic. This is why it's a good idea to go there as soon as you think you might be pregnant. Don't wait to feel your baby move. You need those tablets now.
It's good to eat plenty of foods that are high in folates as well. Find out what foods contain them:

<title>What foods are high in folic acid?</title>
<body>Having foods that are rich in folic acid is great for you and your baby. These foods will be packed with lots of goodness.  
Here are some good foods for you to try:
Eat leafy green vegetables. Most beans including baked beans and black-eyed beans are high in folates. 
Eggs have folates and they give you energy and protein as well. 
Tinned salmon, yeast extract or oranges and orange juice also contain folates.
It's best not to overcook vegetables. This destroys their natural folate. Try to cook them so that they still have a slight crunch to them. If you can, steaming vegetables is even better.

<title>Why am I so constipated?</title>
<body>Being constipated means that you are not passing stools normally. You might have to strain more. Or you might be unable to fully empty your bowels. Your stools might also be unusually hard, lumpy, large or small.
Constipation is a common problem in pregnancy. Almost half of all pregnant women will become constipated at some time. It can be caused by several things.
As your pregnancy progresses, your baby gets bigger. This means that your womb presses down on your pelvic area. This makes constipation more likely.
Pregnancy hormones can also slow the movement of food through your body. A lack of exercise can also slow your system down.
The iron pills that you are given to stop you getting anaemic can cause constipation. But don't stop taking them, as they are very important for you and your baby.

<title>Why do I get tummy cramps?</title>
<body>Cramps and other aches and pains in your belly are normal in pregnancy. They are usually nothing to worry about.
Carrying a baby is hard on your body. So it's not surprising if you feel uncomfortable.
Tough, stretchy tissues called ligaments support your womb. As your baby grows they stretch. When you move around, this may cause mild cramps on one or both sides of your body. 
Resting when you get cramps usually helps. Try sitting down and putting your feet up. Or lie down on the other side to the pain. You could also try a warm bath.
Sometimes, having sex can give you cramps and a bit of backache. An orgasm sends ripples up through your vagina and uterus. This can leave a crampy feeling afterwards. This is common in the last three months of pregnancy.
But, sometimes cramps can be a sign of a problem. If you feel unwell, have bleeding or are leaking fluid go to the clinic.

<title>How to prevent infections - hand washing</title>
<body>Now you're pregnant, your body is working hard to grow and develop. Your body is busy creating a new baby. 
You need to be extra careful about good hygiene - especially if you are HIV+. Washing your hands is one of the easiest ways to help you protect yourself against diseases. It's also one of the easiest ways to prevent infections that can cause diarrhoea. Wash your hands:
<ul>
    <li> when you come home</li>
    <li>when you go to the toilet</li>
    <li>after dealing with animals</li>
    <li>before cooking or handling raw eggs, meat or fish</li>
    <li>before you eat.</li>
</ul>
All you need is clean water and soap. Make sure you wash your wrists, hands and nails. Wash the soap off your hands with clean water. 
Just by washing your hands, you can really reduce the risk of diseases like diarrhoea. And It's simple and easy!

<title>How do I know I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>Wondering if you're pregnant? There are many signs that can tell you if you are. The surest sign of pregnancy is a missed period, but if your cycle is unpredictable it can be hard to decide if your period is late.
If you think that you may be expecting a baby, it is best if you go to the clinic. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new arrival. The clinic will also be able to give you advice and support throughout your pregnancy.
Look at these signs of pregnancy. If you think you have any of these signs, go to the clinic:

<title>Can sex harm my baby?</title>
<body>You won't hurt your baby by having sex, even with your partner on top.
Your baby is protected inside you by a thick mucus plug. This plug seals your cervix and helps to protect your baby. He floats in a bag of fluid and the strong muscles of your womb also protect him.
If you orgasm, you may notice your baby moves around more. This is not because he knows what's happening or feels worried. He can feel your heart beat faster, that's all.
But, sometimes it is best to not have sex:
If you have had bleeding with pains or cramps in your belly.
If your waters broke early in your last pregnancy, or if you have lost a pregnancy.
If you have been told you have a low-lying placenta. This is particularly important if you have had any bleeding.
You should avoid sex during pregnancy if your partner has genital herpes. If you catch genital herpes for the first time during pregnancy, there's a small risk that it could affect your baby. Get help at the clinic if you are worried.

<title>I am bleeding and have cramps - is this a miscarriage?</title>
<body>A miscarriage is the loss of a baby before it is able to stay alive on its own outside your body.
Miscarriage is a worry many mothers share. Sadly, it can be common during the early months of pregnancy. The most obvious signs that you are having a miscarriage are period-like pains and heavy bleeding. You may see quite large blood clots as well. Bleeding from a miscarriage usually becomes steadily heavier.  Many women mistake a miscarriage for a late period.
Miscarriage after three months is much less common. The signs of late miscarriage are heavy bleeding, and, sometimes, your waters breaking. You may also have intense, labour-like pains or strong backache.
If you are bleeding or you think you are having a miscarriage it can be a very scary time. The best thing to do is to tell your family. You need to go to the clinic straight away. Your partner or another person should go with you to support you.

<title>Is it safe to drink cola now I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>You don't have to give up favourite drinks because you're pregnant. But you may need to cut down a little. Cola contains caffeine and too much is not good for you or your baby.
Having a couple of cans of cola a day won't do any harm. Caffeine makes your heart beat faster and makes you feel more alert. You might feel your baby moving a bit more after you've had a couple of cans. Running fast will have the same effect so it's nothing to worry about.
If you drink a lot of cola before you go to bed, it might keep you awake. You could have a headache after the caffeine has left your system. To help prevent this, spread your drinks of cola throughout the day and try not to have any too close to bedtime. Drinking other fluids such as water will also help to prevent headaches.
If you are worried about the effects of caffeine, try drinking decaffeinated versions. It tastes almost the same as regular cola.

<title>Is it safe to drink coffee now I'm pregnant?</title>
<body>Coffee contains caffeine. Drinking small amounts is fine, but too much can cause problems for you and your baby. 
Caffeine increases your heart rate and makes you feel more alert. Your baby might feel a bit active after you've had a cup. A cup or two a day won't harm him. Running for the bus has the same effect.
You may also find that it makes you want to urinate more. It can also keep you awake at night and leave you with a headache. Try to stick to just a couple of cups a day. This will help cut down your trips to the toilet and will also help prevent headaches. Drink plenty of other fluids such as water throughout the day to stay hydrated.
If you love coffee, try to drink it between meals. It can reduce how much iron you absorb from your food. You could also try switching to instant coffee. It's slightly lower in caffeine. You could also make it weaker by using less.

<title>Why do I need to take iron tablets?</title>
<body>Many women don't get enough iron from their food. Most pregnant women need to take extra iron in a tablet to make sure they get enough.
During pregnancy you need to be sure that you're getting enough iron. You need it to help keep you and your baby healthy. 
Iron is important because you need it to carry oxygen around your body. If you don't have enough iron your baby can be born early or very weak.  If you don't have enough iron in your blood, the organs and tissues in your body won't get as much oxygen as they usually do. This can make you pale, tired and breathless. This is called anaemia, and it  is very common in pregnancy. The clinic will give you an iron

<title>How to cope with feeling tired</title>
<body>It's normal to feel exhausted or weary, especially in the first few months of pregnancy. Growing a baby is tiring, even though your baby is still tiny. If you are HIV+, you may find that you are extra tired.
You may get more energy as your pregnancy goes on.  For now, rest when you can. Even a short break can help you cope. Have regular cool drinks and small snacks to help keep your energy levels up. Fresh air can help if you feel sleepy. 
During your pregnancy, avoid demanding activity and exercise. Heavy lifting can put an extra strain on your body. Ask your family and friends to help with lifting heavy buckets or furniture. This will help to make sure your baby stays healthy inside you and that you do not hurt yourself.
You may have to tell someone you are pregnant if you are so tired that you need to sleep in the day. Even if you just tell one person in your family, they can look out for you and give you a hand.

<body>Calcium forms your baby's bones and teeth. It also helps to control the rhythm of his heart. If you're not getting enough calcium your baby won't go without, but you will. That's because, where minerals are concerned, your body puts your baby first. 
Calcium is a mineral that helps bones and teeth to grow. You need plenty of calcium, because your bones are still growing too. It may also help reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
Dairy foods are the best way to get calcium. You can get it from milk, yoghurt and cheese. A couple of cups of milk with either a cheese sandwich or a small pot of yoghurt every day will give you enough. 
You can also get calcium from green leafy vegetables, tofu and some fish such as  sardines.
To help you absorb calcium you also need to make sure you're getting enough vitamin D. Your body makes vitamin D from sunlight, and you can also get it from eating oily fish and some cereals.

<title>I have a pain in my tummy</title>
<body>Mild aches and pains are common in pregnancy. Most are not dangerous and will get better if you can rest. 
 As your body stretches with your bump you may get an ache in your lower belly. Getting some rest should ease this.  Indigestion, heartburn, or a tummy bug can also cause pains. They usually get better quickly. 
 If you are near the end of your pregnancy and you have pains across your belly that come and go you might be in labour. Count how often the pains come and how long they last. If they are getting stronger and closer together it's time to go to the clinic for the birth of your baby!
But, some aches and pains aren't as normal. Here are some that may need treatment at the clinic:

You will also need to go to the clinic to get treatment. Make sure you finish all the medicine you are given, otherwise the infection could come back.</body>

<title>Importance of antenatal care: right to make complaints</title>
<body>Going to the clinic for regular check-ups is one of the best things you can do for your baby. You will benefit from the experience of the clinic staff by visiting them regularly.
You have the right to be treated with respect and dignity at the clinic. 
The clinic staff will check your baby is okay. They will be able to answer your questions. They will also check if you are well and will recommend the right treatment if you need it.
If you haven't been to the clinic yet, plan to go soon. You should go to the clinic at least four times during your pregnancy. 
If you are unhappy with the treatment, you can make a complaint. 

Check if there's a complaints box. Write down your complaint with your name and telephone number and put it into the box. Or you could speak to the head of department.

<title>How long will my sickness last?</title>
<body>Pregnancy sickness usually starts in the second month of pregnancy. You will often feel better by three months, but it can last longer. 
A few women feel sick for most of the pregnancy. Sometimes sickness comes back if you are tired or have not drunk enough water. Make sure you drink throughout the day. Try sipping lots of cool drinks.
Most women learn how to cope with their sickness. This helps them to feel sick less often.
Having an empty stomach can make nausea worse. Try eating a dry biscuit before you get up in the morning. You could also try eating little and often. You might also find cold food easier to keep down.  If your sickness is still unbearable, go to the clinic. 
Sickness is normal, but sometimes it isn't always due to pregnancy. Go to the clinic for a check-up if you see these signs. You may need treatment.

<title>What is spotting and is it normal?</title>
<body>Spotting is light bleeding from your vagina. Spotting can be caused by many things. 
It could be caused by the hormones that control your periods. These hormones may trigger bleeding when your period would have been due. You may have this more than once.
When the egg settles into your womb, it can also cause bleeding. This type of light bleeding usually lasts a day or two.
Pregnancy hormones can change the surface of the cervix, making it more likely to bleed. You may also have harmless growths in the lining of your womb or cervix which start bleeding. 
Your baby is likely to be fine. Spotting or light bleeding is usually harmless. It's only natural for you to worry about it, but many pregnancies carry on despite early bleeding. Even so, it is best to go to the clinic to have it checked. It will give you peace of mind.

<title>Clean water matters</title>
<body>It's important you do everything possible to stay healthy. Unclean water can be home to lots of nasty diseases. This can cause you to have diarrhoea or stomach flu. 
Tap water is usually fine. But, if there is no clean water where you live or if you are not sure how clean the water is, there's a simple way to make it clean:
Pour the water through a clean cotton cloth, and then boil it. This will get rid of the germs. Cool boiled water is safe to drink. Boil up a large bucket for the day. Keep it in a cool secluded area and cover it. This will stop flies and dirt getting in. 
If you cannot boil water, bleach will help to make it safe. Put one teaspoon of bleach into 250ml of water. Mix and leave it to stand for at least two hours. Make sure you keep it covered.
If you buy bottled water, always check that the seal on the bottle is not broken. A broken seal means the water has been opened before. The bottle could have been refilled if the seal is broken.

<title>High blood pressure</title>
<body>Blood pressure checks at the clinic are an important part of your pregnancy care. If you have high blood pressure, you might need medicine to control it. 
High blood pressure is bad for you and your baby. It puts an extra strain on your kidneys, and it can mean that your baby does not get all the nutrients and oxygen he needs. 
If you are very overweight you are more likely to get high blood pressure.
High blood pressure also means you're more likely to get pre-eclampsia. The clinic will be looking for signs of this, particularly in late pregnancy. The clinic will test your urine as well as taking your blood pressure. Protein in your urine, high blood pressure and sudden swelling of your hands feet and face are all signs of pre-eclampsia. 
You can have high blood pressure and not feel ill at all. The only way to tell is to have your blood pressure checked at the clinic. So go to the clinic as soon as you have missed two periods.

<title>What can I do to feel less sick?</title>
<body>Try changing what you eat. Choose foods that aren't spicy and don't have a strong smell or taste. Some women find they can eat cold food but not hot food.
If your sickness is mostly in the mornings, it might help to eat a dry biscuit before you get up. 
If the smell of food makes you sick, try to get someone else to cook for you. You may find it easier to keep food down if you have not had to cook it.
 Also, try eating small meals but more often.
Ginger helps some women. A ginger biscuit, some ginger grated into a cup of tea or even just the smell of freshly grated ginger can help. You could also try chewing mints.
Explain to your family and friends how you're feeling and what you need. You are ill. Don't feel guilty about asking for help with things like shopping, cooking and chores.

<title>How much weight will I put on?</title>
<body>You are going to put on weight now you are pregnant. You are meant to. Your body is growing and changing to give your baby the best start in life. 
A lot of your extra weight will come from your baby, the placenta and the fluid around the baby. Your baby will grow to around 3 kilos by the time he is born. The placenta will weight around a kilo. Your womb muscles grow much bigger and heavier as well. 
You also get extra blood and fluid in your body during pregnancy. Your body will start to store more fat too, ready for feeding your baby when he's born.
By the end of pregnancy you may weigh about 10 to 12 kilos more than you did before you became pregnant. This is only a rough idea of your weight gain.

<title>Signs of an ectopic pregnancy</title>
<body>Pain in your shoulder and one side could be signs of an ectopic pregnancy. It may feel like period pains or like you're having a miscarriage, with cramping and slight bleeding. Symptoms may come and go. 
You may have unusual bleeding, different from your normal period. It may be lighter and brighter, or darker red than usual, or watery.
Pain on one side in your lower belly may come on gradually or suddenly. It could feel really bad.  
If your ectopic pregnancy is not noticed by a doctor early, your tube may be stretched by your growing baby, and break. This will usually cause bleeding inside. You may be sweating and feel light-headed, faint or dizzy. You might have diarrhoea or pain when you go to the toilet.
You might feel pain at the tip of your shoulder. This happens if the bleeding irritates other organs. The pain may be worse when you lie down.
If you feel at all like this, go straight to the clinic. Staff there will be able to help you.

<title>Pregnancy nutrition</title>
<body>Now that you are growing a baby you need to eat good food every day. Now is a good time to make a plan to eat well. Doing so will help you to have a healthier pregnancy.
It can be hard knowing what you need to eat. You may wonder why certain foods are good for you and your baby.  Try to make sure you have fresh foods, a variety of different foods and enough food each day to give you energy and help you grow your baby.

<title>Preventing tetanus</title>
<body>Tetanus is a serious disease. You can get it through a deep wound, a cut or a burn. The process of labour puts you at risk of getting tetanus as the germs can enter through the birth canal. Your baby is also at risk because germs can get in through the umbilical cord. 
Tetanus can be prevented by the TT vaccine which comes in the form of an injection. This will give you the ability to fight any tetanus germs that may enter your body. 
Vaccines don't work as a cure. But they do protect you from disease. So don't wait until you get tetanus! 
You will get the TT vaccine at your first clinic visit. Even if you were vaccinated earlier, you may need more doses to make sure you are still protected.  If you haven't had your TT vaccine, go get it now.
When you go to the clinic, they will check that you are protected from tetanus. If you have any questions about the tetanus vaccine, ask at the clinic.

<title>Folic acid</title>
<body>Folic acid is found in lentils, peas and beans, green vegetables, some fruit, and yeast and beef extracts. It helps to protect your baby from developing defects  of his spine.
Spina bifida  means 'open spine' and it happens when the protective covering that grows round a baby's spinal cord doesn't close properly. This can lead to permanent nerve damage. 
In the first three months of your pregnancy, your baby's brain and nerve system are growing fast. Your body needs more folic acid then. That's why it's important to start taking your daily iron and folic acid pill as soon as you can. You can get them at the clinic. Go as soon as you think you are pregnant.
It's good to eat plenty of folate-rich food. Try eating any dark green vegetables, black-eyed beans, potatoes, eggs and oranges.
It's best not to overcook vegetables, because this destroys their goodness. Make sure they are still a bit crunchy.

<title>My nipples are getting darker and larger</title>
<body>Skin changes are common during pregnancy. One of the first changes you may notice is the circle of skin round your nipples getting darker. This starts to happen in the second month of pregnancy. 
During pregnancy your body makes more of certain hormones.  One hormone makes the areas of your skin that are usually dark get even darker. Moles and freckles get darker, as well as the skin around your nipples.
This darkening of the skin around your nipples will help your baby find her way towards your breasts to feed. 
You may also notice that tiny bumps on your breasts appear or get bigger. These tiny bumps produce an oily substance. It helps to keep your nipples clean and prevent soreness. It also protects your nipples from getting infected during breastfeeding.

<title>Don't take traditional remedies</title>
<body>If you've told your friends and family that you are pregnant, you have probably heard them recommend traditional remedies. 
Before you got pregnant, you might have taken these remedies or thought about going to a traditional healer.  But now that you are pregnant, you should rather go to a clinic. Traditional remedies are not safe for your growing baby. 
Stalls at the market may have tonics and remedies that say will help you feel better through your pregnancy. But these are not safe. They can do more harm than good. 
Just because some medication is easy to get, does not mean it's safe for pregnant women. 
If you feel unwell, go to the clinic. Don't take any treatment unless it's recommended by the clinic.

<title>I have a white itchy discharge - what is it?</title>
<body>It's normal to have more vaginal discharge while you're pregnant. Healthy discharge is thin and milky in colour. It's not that different from the discharge you had before you were pregnant. There's just a lot more of it.
Sometimes the discharge becomes thick, white and creamy. You may also have itching, soreness or redness in or around your vagina or your bottom. It might hurt when you have sex or when you urinate.
This is likely to be thrush. 
Thrush is caused by a fungus. Usually, it lives harmlessly in the vagina. You won't know you're carrying it. It only becomes a problem when it grows out of control.
You're more likely to get thrush if you're pregnant because the vaginal secretions are richer in sugar. This makes it easier for thrush to grow. 
You may find thrush comes and goes while you're pregnant. Although it may take a while to clear up and be a bit of a nuisance, it isn't anything to worry about.

<title>I'm bleeding and it hurts</title>
<body>Bleeding with pain in pregnancy always needs attention at the clinic.
Heavy bleeding may be a sign of miscarriage. Early miscarriage usually happens when a baby is not developing properly. Bleeding from a miscarriage becomes steadily heavier. 
Light bleeding, with severe, one-sided pain in your tummy may be an ectopic pregnancy. This happens when the baby starts to grow outside your womb. The bleeding may be dark and watery. An ectopic pregnancy has to be treated quickly. 
Dark bleeding with clots may mean that the placenta is coming away from the wall of your womb.
It is possible for a blow to the outside of your tummy to start you bleeding. It can be set off by a fall, an accident, or if someone hits your belly.
Whatever the cause, it is important to go to the clinic quickly if you are bleeding and in pain. You and your baby need to be checked now.

<title>Tummy cramps and miscarriage</title>
<body>Tummy cramps are usually nothing to worry about in early pregnancy. But sometimes it may mean you need to get help. 
Sadly, miscarriage is fairly common in the first three months of pregnancy. It usually happens because a baby isn't developing properly. It isn't anyone's fault.
Tummy cramps with spotting and bleeding may be a sign of miscarriage. Some women also feel pain in the centre of their lower belly. If you notice these signs, don't wait. Go to the clinic straight away. Staff there will be able to check that all is well.
Later in pregnancy, tummy cramps on their own are probably nothing to worry about. But if you have bleeding or discharge as well, it is best to get it checked at the clinic.
You also need to go to the clinic for help if your bleeding is very heavy. If you are soaking more than one sanitary pad in an hour, you need help now. Ask someone to get you to the clinic straight away.

<title>Alcohol</title>
<body>If you drink alcohol, it can affect how your baby grows - as alcohol gets through the placenta. It can also cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), a condition of poor growth in the womb and after birth. 
Drinking can damage your baby's nervous system. He may find it hard to talk, learn and remember. He may be born small and will carry on being small for his age. His brain can be permanently damaged. 
Some babies with FAS will have heart problems. Others may have kidney problems. The more you drink, and the more often you drink, the greater the effect it can have on your baby. 
Frequent, heavy drinking can also cause problems with your pregnancy. You could miscarry or your baby could be born early. 
There is no cure for this condition, but it can be prevented. It is best to not drink at all during your pregnancy. Even if you are not sure if you are pregnant, it is wise to stop drinking. Don't take any risks with your baby's health.
If you are worried about how your drinking may have affected your baby, talk to someone at the antenatal clinic.

<title>My breasts are sore and tingling</title>
<body>Your breasts may feel sore even before you know you are pregnant. One of the earliest signs that you're pregnant is sensitive, sore and tingling breasts. If you notice this you are probably about four weeks pregnant. You probably won't have had a pregnancy test yet. It's a good idea to go to the clinic for a test as soon as you feel this soreness.
Your breasts may become very tender. This tenderness could feel like a stronger version of how your breasts usually feel before a period.
Even your clothes brushing against them may be unbearable. You may also find that you no longer like having your breasts touched. This will pass. The soreness is likely to lessen after the first three months.
As your body changes to support your growing baby, you make more hormones. Once you're six months pregnant, your surging hormone levels will have settled down. However, you may still notice tenderness now and then throughout your pregnancy.
Wearing a good, supportive bra will help you to feel more comfortable.

<title>Why is my hair falling out?</title>
<body>In pregnancy you actually grow more hair and it is often much thicker. This is because of the pregnancy hormones in your body.  It can seem as if your hair is falling out because the new hair causes older hair to fall out. So if you wash your hair and the sink is full of hairs it can worry you. 
Dry hair may become drier due to pregnancy hormones. Your hair will be more prone to break, particularly in late pregnancy. If it breaks near the roots it might look like hair loss, although it actually isn't. 
Check with the clinic to make sure there is no other reason for your problem. If you have long-term medical or dietary problems, there might be another cause.
It is fairly certain that your hair will return to normal after the birth of your baby. There's no reason to think that it will happen again in a future pregnancy.
Meanwhile, do not brush your hair too much. Treat it gently and use a mild shampoo. Be careful about the use of chemicals, such as colours, perms or relaxers. Hair can react differently to treatments during pregnancy.

<title>Pregnancy and HIV</title>
<body>One of the tests you will have at your first clinic visit is an HIV test. This will tell you whether you have HIV or not.
It's good to know early on if you have HIV, as you will be given the right kind of care for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.
There are things you can do to make sure you stay well and your baby does not get HIV too. 
You will need medicines called antiretrovirals (ARVs). ARVs help you to control your HIV and prevent it from worsening. ARVs help you live a healthy life.
ARVs also help to make sure that HIV does not spread to your baby. 
It is also important to get your CD4 count checked. This will tell you how much HIV has progressed. Your care and treatment will vary according to your CD4 count. You should have this done every 6 months.
Find out at the clinic where you can have your CD4 count checked. 
If you have any questions about HIV, call the National AIDS helpline on 0800 012 32

<title>Is it safe to have hot baths during pregnancy?</title>
<body>Having a bath is safe while you are pregnant.
But, you need to be careful with very  hot baths. They could raise your body temperature. This could be dangerous for your baby. Overheating, particularly in the early months of pregnancy, may cause problems with your baby's brain and spine.
However, this risk is small, because baths cool rapidly.
If the bath water is too hot you could also feel faint or sick. The heat can lower your blood pressure a bit too much. This can affect blood flow to your baby. That's unsafe at any stage of your pregnancy.
Test the water with your elbow or the inside of your arm before getting in. This part of your skin is more sensitive to temperature than your feet or hands. The water should be cool enough for you to get straight in, instead of bit by bit! If your skins turns red and you are sweating, then the water is too hot.

<title>What are piles?</title>
<body>Piles are also called haemorrhoids. They are swollen veins in your bottom. They are common during pregnancy as the veins below your womb can become swollen and stretched. Piles can be painful and itchy.
There are several blood vessels in your anal canal. Your anal canal is the short tube that connects your back passage with its opening. It helps you move your bowels by releasing mucus when you pass a stool.
These blood vessels can become swollen. They may hang down during or after you've passed a stool. You may be able to feel them as small, soft lumps inside or around the edge of your bottom.
You may notice bright red blood after you've passed a stool. You might see some of this when you wipe your bottom, too. Piles are the most common cause of bleeding in pregnancy. But any bleeding from your bottom should be checked by the clinic.
You may also get piles when you push out your baby. They often disappear shortly after the birth.

<title>Why am I getting headaches?</title>
<body>It's common to get headaches during pregnancy, particularly in the first three months. If you had headaches before you were pregnant, pregnancy can make them worse.
Migraine headaches can make you feel nauseous and sensitive to light, sounds and smells. 
Headaches and migraines may be caused by pregnancy hormones .  Feeling tired or stressed can tense your muscles. 
Skipping meals and feeling hungry might bring on a headache. Or having more sleep than usual, or too little sleep.
Your headaches may always appear on a certain area of your head. Or you may get them in different places. They may cause a sharp throbbing pain, or a dull general ache. It is different for each person.

You might feel breathless and your heartbeat might seem very fast.
Another symptom of not having enough iron is that you might have nails which are spoon-shaped. This means that they curve inwards instead of outwards. Pale eyelids are also a symptom.
You could have a sore tongue and a strange taste in your mouth.
Less common symptoms are headaches and a ringing in your ears. Some women get unusual cravings.
If you have any of these signs, you need to tell the clinic. You might need treatment. Severe anaemia can also make it more likely for you to develop an infection.

<title>What not to eat</title>
<body>You need to eat well to help your baby grow. If you are HIV+, it's even more important to eat good foods and plenty of them to help your body cope. Sweet foods and drinks are unhealthy for you now. Try to have less fizzy drinks and cakes. Have some fresh fruit instead. 
Coffee and tea have caffeine, which can prevent you from getting iron from your meals. This can make you tired and weak. Try to have just one cup of coffee or tea a day - or drink tea that doesn't have caffeine in it, like Rooibos. 
Fried, fatty foods are also not healthy. Instead, try to have lots of fresh vegetables. Try to have meat, fish, eggs or beans at every meal. You can make salads or soups with plenty of vegetables, meat or beans in them.
Try not to take any herbal or traditional medicines before checking with the clinic first to see if it's safe. What traditional healers recommend may not always be safe for pregnant women. Go to the clinic instead. They'll be able to help you with any problems.

<title>Why do I need to urinate so often?</title>
<body>Frequent trips to the toilet are a common problem in pregnancy. It is most common in the first three months and the last three months of pregnancy. 
Pregnancy hormones are one cause. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby grows, your body will produce more urine. This makes you need to urinate more often.
Another reason is that your growing baby sits on top of your bladder and squashes it, so it can hold less urine. This may make it hard for you to empty your bladder fully.  And, even when your bladder is empty, the pressure on it from the baby can make it feel full. You may feel this pressure even more late in pregnancy. This is because your baby's head has dropped down low in your body, ready for birth.

<title>Why am I breathless?</title>
<body>It is common to feel short of breath in pregnancy. Even if you've never felt breathless before, you may feel short of breath now. Your body does a better job of using the air you breathe in pregnancy. You're breathing at the same rate as you did before, but now you breathe much more deeply. This is one of the main reasons that you feel breathless.
It happens because of natural changes to your body. You are adapting to carrying your baby.
You may have noticed that you've got broader around your ribcage. This is because your ribcage moves up and outwards while you're pregnant. It does this to let your lungs get bigger.
Towards the end of pregnancy, the size of your growing baby can make you breathless. Your womb begins to push upwards and squash your lungs. This breathlessness is normal and harmless and will stop once your baby is born.
You may be breathless if you are lacking in iron. Taking iron tablets will help.

<title>I have the flu - how can I treat it?</title>
<body>If you have flu you may have a fever, headaches, chills, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite.
The best thing you can do is get plenty of bed rest. Stay away from work until you are fully recovered. Try to stay cool.
Drink plenty of water, especially if you have a fever. Try drinking fruit juices with Vitamin C, like orange or lemon juice. This will help you fight off the infection.
You won't feel like eating at first. When you do, try to eat something healthy. Have some fruit, bread, or a warm, milky drink.
You can take medicine to lower your fever and soothe aches and pains. Ask your clinic or pharmacy for medicine that is suitable during pregnancy.
If breathing is difficult, see the clinic. You may have another infection, like a chest infection, which will need treatment. Your body is busy protecting your baby, so a cold can turn into something worse.

<title>What can I do about thrush?</title>
<body>Thrush likes to be warm and moist to grow. So try to keep your vagina cool and dry. 
Tight or synthetic clothing creates warmth and lack of air. Try loose cotton instead.
Make sure you wipe your bottom from front to back after you've been to the toilet.
Make sure your vagina is well lubricated before you have sex.
Perfumed bubble bath or scented panty liners may cause irritation. Try not to use them.
If you are taking antibiotics for an infection, this can cause an outbreak of thrush, as the antibiotics kill off the good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria. 
Thrush can be hard to clear up during pregnancy. Treatments that work for non-pregnant women may not get rid of it now.
Shop-bought treatments are expensive and unlikely to work. Don't treat thrush by taking medicines that you have to swallow. We don't know if they are safe to take when you're pregnant.
It's best to go to the clinic to get the right treatment. They can give you a cream to use that is safe.
If your partner has signs of thrush, he'll need treating, too. He might re-infect you when you have sex.

<title>What foods do I need to eat?</title>
<body>Now that you're pregnant, it is important to eat well. This will make sure you get all the nutrients you and your baby need. Your meals should include a variety of foods.
Make starchy foods the basis of each meal. These foods give you energy and help maintain your weight. Choose bread, pap, porridge, cereals, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, samp, millets, mealies, sorghum and pasta.
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They supply vitamins and other things you and your baby need. Include fruits and vegetables that are yellow, orange, red and dark green. Try spinach, morogo, pumpkin and pumpkin leaves, green peppers, sweet potato, squash, carrots, peaches, paw-paws, apricots and mangoes.
Citrus fruits like oranges, naartjies, grapefruits, lemons, guavas, mangoes, tomatoes, moroelas and potatoes give you vitamin C. They make great snacks.
Protein helps build muscle. All kinds of meat, Mopani worms and other insects contain protein. Eggs, milk and dairy products like maas, sour milk, yoghurt and buttermilk do too. If you can't get meat, beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, soya or tofu are good sources.

<title>My breasts seem to be growing very fast</title>
<body>Your breasts getting sore and growing in size is a sign that you are pregnant. Along with soreness, your breasts start to get bigger as soon as you become pregnant.
The fat layer in your breasts thickens and your milk glands enlarge and your veins become more pronounced. You might find these changes uncomfortable, but they have an important purpose. They are preparing your breasts for feeding your baby.
Your breasts will continue to grow during pregnancy. You will notice it much more if this is your first pregnancy. You're likely to have gone up a couple of bra sizes by the time you have your baby.
You may notice other changes, too. Some women find their breasts throb or tingle as blood rushes to them during lovemaking.
Wearing a well-fitting, supportive bra will help you to feel comfortable. 
If you haven't been for a pregnancy test, it's a good idea to do it now. The clinic will be able to look after you and your developing baby better the earlier you go.

<title>When will I feel my baby kick?</title>
<body>Feeling your baby move is an exciting time in your pregnancy. It may take you a while to realise that those fluttering feelings in your belly are your baby's movements.  You will probably start to be aware of your baby's movements when you're four months pregnant, but it can be later. 
If you've had a baby before, you'll know the signs. You'll probably notice him moving a bit earlier this time. 
Your baby starts to move long before you feel anything. Gradually, the movements become strong enough for you to feel. You'll soon be used to him kicking as he stretches his arms and legs.
You may start to notice your baby hiccupping. It'll feel like a jerking movement. He may also jump at sudden noises. 
Your baby won't move constantly. Sometimes he just wants rest and sleep. Near the end of your pregnancy, he'll rest for about 45 minutes at a time. It might feel longer than this, because you won't feel every movement.

<title>What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?</title>
<body>A urinary tract infection (or UTI) is caused when your urine tubes become infected by germs. 
You're more likely to get UTIs during pregnancy because of changes in your body. Pregnancy hormones relax the muscles of the urine tubes.
This slows down the flow of urine, and means that bugs have more time to grow before they're flushed out. Cystitis, an infection of the bladder, is a common UTI. You're much more likely to get this while you're pregnant. If left untreated, UTIs can be quite painful. They may cause other problems if the infection reaches your kidneys.
A kidney infection needs to be treated during pregnancy. If it's not, your baby could be born too early. Your kidneys may also be damaged, so quick treatment is very important. 
If you have any worries about your urine, go to the clinic. You may need some medicine.

<title>Four ways to stay healthy in pregnancy</title>
<body>One - eat well. Try to eat some fruits and vegetables every day. Eat some meat or lentils, peas and beans. A yoghurt and an egg each day will also give your baby a boost. 
Two - go to the clinic for at least four check-ups during your pregnancy. Check-ups will help keep you and your baby healthy. Any problems can be spotted early. You will then be able to get treatment and keep your baby safe. 
Three - get tested for HIV. If you are HIV+ you can take free medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from getting HIV. If you know you are HIV-, you can make sure you stay that way.
Four- take the pills you are given at the clinic and they will help your baby grow well. If the clinic is out of stock, ask them when you can come back. By simply taking your pills, you will be doing a great deal for your baby.

<title>Make sure your food is safe</title>
<body>You are more likely to get ill from bad food when you are pregnant and if you have HIV. There are ways to make sure your food is safe. 
Wash fruits and vegetables in clean water before cooking them. Soil or dirt contains germs that are harmful for your baby.
Cook your food using clean water. Putting clean food in dirty water will make the food full of germs again. 
Make sure your food is cooked well. Food that has not been cooked properly will still have germs. Cook meat until it is not pink in the middle and cook fish until it flakes. If you are eating eggs, make sure they are fresh. Cook eggs until the middle is firm.
Old or stale food can make you ill. Even if you're saving money, it's best not to eat old food. Rather throw it away.
Milk can quickly become full of germs. Drink fresh milk that has been boiled or pasteurised. This will remove any germs.  
It's best not to eat food from stalls. It may have been prepared in unclean conditions. Instead, take some bread or biscuits, fruit and clean water when you go out. This will give you energy and keep you refreshed during the day.

<title>I have a cold - how can I treat it?</title>
<body>Colds can make you feel miserable. You may have a sore throat, cough, blocked nose, headache or mild fever.
The best treatment is to relax and rest when you feel tired. Drink plenty of water.
If you have a blocked nose, try using steam to unblock it. Heat a bowl or pan of hot water. Lean over the bowl with a towel over your head and breathe in the steam. 
If you have a sore throat or cough, drinking a mixture of honey and lemon in hot water is comforting.
If you have a headache or a fever, you can take some medicine. Make sure to check with your clinic or pharmacy first. 
You may want to take cough and cold medicines, but again you should check at the clinic or pharmacy first. Many remedies which are usually safe are not suitable during pregnancy.
With all medicine, it's best to use as little medicine as possible for the shortest time possible.

<title>I have a burning feeling after eating: is this heartburn?</title>
<body>Yes. Heartburn is common when you're carrying a baby, and it can be painful. Most mums-to-be start getting heartburn and indigestion in the second half of pregnancy, but you can get it earlier.
Heartburn is a burning feeling. You may be able to feel it from your lower throat to the bottom of your breastbone. It happens when acid from your stomach is brought up into your throat or mouth, leaving a bitter taste.It is caused by changes in your body that pregnancy brings.
An increase in pregnancy hormones relaxes the muscles in your womb and stomach. This allows acid to go up into your throat, causing a burning feeling.
Hormones also slow down the movements in your stomach. This slows your digestion and makes heartburn more likely.
In later pregnancy, your growing baby pushes your guts and stomach upwards. This also slows digestion and forces stomach acids up into your throat.
The main triggers are eating, lying down and bending over.
The signs will disappear with no harmful effects after your baby is born.

<title>Why are my hands tingling and numb?</title>
<body>You may feel pain, tingling and numbness in your hands during pregnancy. It is probably caused by something called carpal tunnel syndrome.
The carpal tunnel is a small tunnel that runs from the bottom of your wrist to your lower palm. The nerves running through this tunnel control feeling and movement in your hand. 
Most pregnant women have some swelling in their hands during pregnancy. This swelling presses on the tunnel and squashes the nerves. This causes tingling and numbness in your hands and fingers.
Your hand and arm might ache. You might not be able to grip as well as usual. The skin of your hand may feel dry or swell, too.
Symptoms are often worse at night, but can affect your daily activities, too.
Symptoms can appear at any time. If you feel this tingling, it will probably be mild and disappear soon after your baby is born. For some mothers it can be more severe and may last for several months or longer.

<title>Why do I keep feeling dizzy?</title>
<body>Dizziness is common in pregnancy. In your first three months, you may feel dizzy and sick because of low blood pressure. Pregnancy hormones relax your blood vessels, which causes your blood pressure to fall. 
After three months, your growing womb squeezes your blood vessels in your legs, pelvis and lower body. This can cause dizziness. If you have low levels of iron in your blood, this can make you dizzy too.
You might feel dizzy if you stand up too quickly. Try getting up slowly and smoothly.
If you lie down on your back you may feel dizzy. Turn onto your left side. This helps your heart pump blood round your body more easily.
You may feel dizzy if you haven't eaten for a while. Give yourself an energy boost by eating a healthy snack. Try to drinks lots of water and fruit juice. You should also try to stay cool and out of the sun.
You may not be able to do anything except wait it out. Waves of dizziness are normal during pregnancy, and can happen at any time.

<title>Tuberculosis (TB)</title>
<body>Tuberculosis (TB) can be very dangerous. TB spreads through the air by coughs and sneezes. It can stay in the air for a long time.  
During pregnancy you can catch TB more easily. It's also easier to catch it if you have HIV. So take extra care by eating well and staying away from crowded areas and people coughing and sneezing.
If your partner or a family member has TB, make sure they are treated. They will stop being infectious after taking medication for two days. Make sure they cover their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, and wash their hands regularly. Get yourself tested to confirm you haven't caught it too. 
If you have a cough for more than two weeks or have lost weight unexpectedly - go to the clinic straight away. They will be able to check if you have TB and can give you the right medication. 
TB is curable if it is found early and if all the medicine is taken. It takes at least six months to kill TB. If you finish all the medication, you can kill TB completely.

<title>How often should I feel my baby kick?</title>
<body>All babies move differently. Some may be more active than others. Every baby has a different pattern of waking and sleeping, but you'll come to know what is normal for him. If a change in his pattern worries you, go to your clinic.
Your baby's pattern may not fit your own: he may liven up when you're trying to sleep. 
Your baby becomes more cramped inside your womb as he grows. He will begin to make smaller, more definite movements from seven months. After this time his movements may decrease. This is because your baby will be taking up all the space in your womb. 
In the last month, you may feel jabs and even painful kicks to your ribs. 
In the final two weeks of your pregnancy, the movements are likely to slow down. This is normal. Your baby turns head down ready to be born, and there is not much room for him to move around.

<title>What are stretch marks and how can I prevent them?</title>
<body>Stretch marks are thin lines that usually appear on your belly, breasts and thighs. They are red, purple or brown. Most pregnant women get them.
Pregnancy hormones make your skin thinner. It can be damaged more easily.
You may be more likely to get stretch marks if you're in your teens, or if you are expecting more than one baby. If you had some before you were pregnant, expect some more now.
If your mother got them, you may get them too.
After pregnancy, their colour slowly fades. The streaks become lighter than the rest of your skin. This can take time. They will never fully go away.
Some women have more elastic skin than others. They won't get stretch marks. But for most of us they are simply a fact of pregnancy. 
To keep your skin healthy, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. Drinking lots of clean water will help too. 
You can also help by trying not to put on weight too quickly.

<title>Why are my hands and feet swollen?</title>
<body>It's common to have swelling in pregnancy, particularly in the last three months. Hot weather makes it worse.
Your body is holding too much fluid. It's caused by the extra blood in your body.
As your baby grows, some of your veins are squeezed. This results in blood being trapped in your legs.
The pressure from the trapped blood forces water into the skin of your feet and ankles. This water would normally be absorbed by your body. Pregnant women tend to keep more water than normal, which adds to the swelling.
You'll probably find that the swelling is worse as the day goes on. It will be better in the morning after you've been lying in bed. Later in the day, you may notice that if you press the skin around your ankles, the skin isn't bouncy like it used to be.
At the end of pregnancy, you hands might start to swell. Your rings may feel tight on your fingers. If so, it might be more comfortable to wear them on a chain around your neck instead.

<title>Why does it sting when I urinate?</title>
<body>Go to the clinic if you feel pain or burning when you urinate. You should also go to the clinic if you feel a sense of urgency when you urinate, but you can only produce a few drops at a time.
You may have an infection in your urinary tract, called a UTI. This happens in the tubes that link your bladder to the opening where your water comes out. Go to the clinic as soon as possible. It is easy to treat with antibiotics.
If it is left untreated it can lead to further infection. This could harm your baby and may cause early labour. Keep your baby safe by going to the clinic for treatment. This sort of infection can make you feel very unwell. Antibiotics will make you feel better in a day or so. Make sure you finish the medicine or the infection may come back.
In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids. This will help to wash the infection away.

<title>Malaria</title>
<body>During pregnancy you are more likely to catch infections. So take extra care to keep yourself safe from getting mosquito-related diseases like malaria. Malaria can have serious side effects. There are things you can do to protect yourself.
Sleep under insecticide treated nets. This will help prevent mosquito bites. 
Malaria mosquitoes are more active in the evenings. So stay indoors between dusk and dawn, because mosquitoes like pregnant women. Ask your family to help with outside jobs.
Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colours. Wear long sleeved or full-length light coloured clothing, especially when you go out in the evening. 
Ask at the clinic about mosquito repellents. You can use a cream for your skin and an indoor spray for your house. 
Don't hang too many clothes in your room. They provide hiding places for mosquitoes. Fold your clothes up. 
Mosquitoes breed in still water, rotting leaves and damp areas. Check there are none of these near your home. Pour some oil into open drains to keep mosquitoes away.
If you have a fever, chills, bad headaches or pain in your joints, go to the clinic. Get help early. This will reduce the risk to you and your baby.

<title>Diabetes</title>
<body>
Diabetes is a condition where your body can't make the right amount of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps your body to store and control sugar in your blood.
 If you had diabetes before you became pregnant you need to be extra careful now. Women with diabetes are more likely to have babies with problems. 
Your body will need to make more insulin to support your baby. This means that you have to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels. Make sure you check your blood sugar regularly. 
Going to your check-ups will also help you have a safe pregnancy. The clinic will be able to check your sugar levels. The staff can also guide you on your diet.
It is also a good idea to take extra folic acid. This will help prevent problems in your baby. Ask for them at the clinic.
Not all mothers with diabetes had it before they were pregnant. For some mums diabetes develops during their pregnancy. This is called gestational diabetes. It is not usually a life-long condition like normal diabetes.

<title>I'm not sure my baby has kicked much today</title>
<body>There aren't a set number of kicks you should feel each day.  Every baby has a different pattern of waking and sleeping. Towards the end of your pregnancy, he'll rest for about 45 minutes at a time. The rests might feel longer, because you won't feel every movement. 
There are some ways to encourage your baby to move. Try having a cold drink. The temperature change may cause your baby to wriggle around. Making some noise may also work. You could also try lying on your side and relaxing. This will help you to focus on any movement.
Sometimes, a change in your baby's movement can be a sign of a problem. Go to the clinic if you notice these changes. The staff there will be able to check that all is well.

<title>What can I do to stop urinating so often?</title>
<body>Sadly there is no cure for needing to urinate a lot during pregnancy. Luckily, your need to urinate all the time will stop soon after your baby is born.
It is best not to cut back on how much you're drinking. Cutting down on fluids can make you ill. You need to drink plenty to help carry nutrients to your baby. You should be drinking about six to eight glasses of fluid a day.
If needing to urinate so much really bothers you, try drinking less before bedtime. This might cut down night-time toilet trips.
You may just have to wait until your baby arrives. For the first few days after your baby's birth you'll produce urine even more often. Your body will be getting rid of the extra fluid that you had in your blood system during pregnancy. But, after that your need to urinate will be back to what it was before you were pregnant.

<body>You might feel pain at the back of your pelvis, low down. You might have back pain or shooting pains in your legs too. Sometimes you might feel pain at the front of your pelvis, down by your private parts.
Your pelvis is a ring of bones joined with strong stretchy tissues. When you are pregnant, your body makes a hormone that softens these tough, stretchy tissues.
The hormone helps your bones to move apart and make room for your baby to be born. It can affect your whole body. This is why all your joints move more.
When you are pregnant your body changes in other ways too. You change the way you stand and walk as your baby grows. Sometimes, these changes put stress on your pelvis and cause pain.
Pelvic pain can begin at any time in pregnancy. If it comes on at the very end of your pregnancy, it could be your baby's head moving down into the pelvis.

<title>Supplements to take during pregnancy</title>
<body>While your baby is inside you, you need to make sure your body is strong enough to house him. Eat well.  Make sure to have lots of fruits, vegetables and meat. Lentils are a good substitute for meat.
At your clinic visits, the staff will check to see if you and your baby are fine. They may suggest that you take extra pills to supplement what you eat.
You will be given folic acid pills which will make sure that your baby develops as he should.
You will also be given calcium pills. This will help to keep your blood pressure down. High blood pressure is not good for your baby.
If you lack iron in your body, you will also be given iron pills. Iron pills will help your body make more blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to your baby. It will also give you the strength and energy to carry your baby. 
If you are HIV+, you can get free ARV pills. ARV pills will help you manage your HIV. They will also help to prevent HIV being passed on to your baby. 
Go to the clinic for these pills.

<title>Am I at risk of high blood pressure?</title>
<body>The more overweight you are, the more likely you are to get high blood pressure while you're pregnant.If you are overweight, the best thing you can do is to eat well during pregnancy. Don't go on a diet. Limiting your food could be harmful to you and your baby. Try to eat healthily instead. 
Try to avoid food or drink that is high in fat or sugar. Lots of fruit and vegetables are much better for you both.
Another thing you can do is to go to the clinic as soon as you know you are pregnant. The clinic will check your blood pressure each time you go. You won't be able to tell if your blood pressure has gone up. But the clinic will measure your blood pressure for you.
High blood pressure can mean that you are getting pre-eclampsia. This can be harmful for you and your baby. It can be controlled, but you will need to be checked often. The clinic may give you medicine to help control it.

<title>I have a cough - how can I treat it?</title>
<body>Try making a comforting drink of honey and lemon mixed in hot water to soothe your throat.
It's best not to buy other cough medicines in shops or at the market. Check with your clinic first. Many remedies that are usually safe are not suitable during pregnancy.
When taking medicine, take as little as possible for the shortest time possible.
If your cough doesn't go away, do go to the clinic. You could have another infection. You might need an antibiotic or some other treatment.
If you smoke, you should give up. Not only is it very harmful to your baby, it makes you less able to fight off viruses and infections. Your clinic can help you give up.

<title>What can I do to ease my back pain?</title>
<body>Back pain happens when the tough, stretchy tissues holding your bones together (the ligaments) are strained. It is common in pregnancy. The pregnancy hormones make the ligaments much softer, so they stretch more easily. And the extra weight of your baby also puts extra strain on your back.
When you have to lift something, hold it close to your body. Bend your knees, not your back. Try not to twist. If you have a toddler, see if he can climb onto a chair to be picked up.
Make sure that your back is supported when you're sitting down. Put a small cushion behind your back.  
Rocking your pelvis helps with back pain. Stand with your hands on your hips. Now tuck your tailbone in tight and tilt your tummy in towards your spine. This brings the baby over your hips so the weight is supported by your bones rather than your muscles. Do this little tipping motion to ease the aches whenever you have to stand for long periods. 
 Massage soothes tired, aching muscles. Lean forwards over the back of a chair or lie on your side. Ask your partner or a friend to gently massage your lower back and the muscles that run either side of your spine.
A warm bath, or sleeping on your side with a pillow under your tummy may also help.

<title>Coughs, colds and flu</title>
<body>During pregnancy you are more likely to get sick. This is because your body's natural ability to fight infections is lower than normal. So you may find you catch common viruses such as coughs, colds and the flu. 
Now that you are pregnant, you cannot always take the same medicines that you would have taken before. Sometimes these medicines can be harmful to you or your baby. You may need to rely on getting plenty of rest, having warm drinks and just waiting for your body to heal itself. 
If you don't get better in a few days or think that you may be getting a chest infection, then you need to go to the clinic.

<title>Know your blood group</title>
<body>It's important to know your blood group. Sometimes there are complications in labour. Some women lose a lot of blood and need a blood transfusion. Knowing what your blood group is well in advance will help you identify people with the same blood group. And they might be willing to give you blood if you need it. 
 Blood group O is the most common. Groups A, B, and AB are less so. 
The first time you visit a clinic, you will have a blood test to find out your blood group as well as your HIV status. Once you know your blood group, talk to your relatives and friends. If they have the same blood group as you, ask them if they will donate blood if you need it.
Get their names and contact information. This may come in handy in future.

<title>How is my blood pressure measured?</title>
<body>At the clinic the nurse will use a small machine to measure and record your blood pressure.
You'll need to sit down and remove any tight clothing from your arm. Clinic staff will put fabric around your arm and pump air into it. The fabric is attached to the machine. It works out your blood pressure and shows a reading.
The fabric inflates and briefly stops the blood flow in your arm. It will feel very tight, but it shouldn't hurt. The air in the fabric is slowly let out. 
The reading will have two numbers. The first number shows your blood pressure as your heart beats and pushes the blood round your body. The second number is your blood pressure when your heart relaxes. 
 The average blood pressure range if you are healthy is between 110/70 and 120/80. It tends to vary a lot in pregnancy. By recording it at each visit the clinic can see if your blood pressure has become higher during your pregnancy.

<title>Iodine and calcium rich foods</title>
<body>Your baby is a part of you now. The things that you do will affect him. To help your baby grow healthy and strong you need iodine and calcium. 
Iodine helps your baby's brain develop. It will help him learn and talk when he is born. Not getting enough iodine can have serious effects. It can make it difficult for babies to survive.
 You can find iodine in some salt. Check when you go to the shop that the salt you buy has iodine in it. It should be called iodised salt. Add this to food when you're cooking and you'll get all the iodine you need. 
If you can't find iodised salt where you live, talk to the clinic. They'll be able to give you supplements. You can also get some iodine from food. Yoghurt and milk have good amounts of iodine in them and so do fish and grains. 
Calcium helps your baby's bones and teeth grow. It can also help prevent problems with high blood pressure in late pregnancy. You can get calcium from yoghurt, milk, soya, and vegetables. Make sure that the yoghurt and milk have been pasteurised or boiled first. This kills any germs they might have. The clinic may also give you calcium tablets to take.

<title>Does it matter how much weight I gain?</title>
<body>Putting on lots of weight is not good for you or your baby. It may cause problems later in your pregnancy and during the birth.
If you were carrying extra weight before pregnancy, you should try not to put on too much. Gaining lots of weight could make high blood pressure or diabetes more likely. 
If you eat a healthy diet you can keep you and your baby happy. Try to cut down on snacks that are high in fat and sugar, such as biscuits, cakes, sweets and ice cream. Switch them with healthy snacks such as fresh fruit, a yogurt or a handful of dried fruit. These foods contain more goodness.
If you were very thin before you were pregnant, try to build yourself up over the coming months. Yogurt, eggs, beans and lentils, nuts and red meat are all good foods to eat.
If you have diabetes, you will need to keep your blood sugar levels stable. Go to the clinic for the best advice.

<title>How long will I get headaches for?</title>
<body>Headaches are normally a short term effect of pregnancy. You probably won't get them throughout.
For most women, pregnancy headaches tend to lessen or stop by the middle of pregnancy. This is when the pregnancy hormones settle.
If you had migraines before pregnancy, they may stop during pregnancy. Sadly, once your baby is born they usually go back to the pattern they had before you were pregnant.
If you aren't sure why you have headaches or migraines, try to find out what is triggering them. Once you know the cause, you can take steps to prevent them.
Every day, make a note of the time your headache starts. How severe is your headache? Where is the pain? How long does it last for? 
Also note what you've eaten and when, how active you've been, how stressed or relaxed you've felt, how much sleep you've had and of any medicine you've taken.
After a week you may see a pattern and can work out what is causing your headaches.

<title>Safe sex during pregnancy</title>
<body>Even though you are pregnant, you still need to use condoms to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV.
STIs are bacterial or viral illnesses. You can get them from having any type of sex with an infected partner. STIs can make you and your baby very ill. 
Some infections can pass to your baby in pregnancy. Others can be transmitted during the birth. Newborn infections can be very serious, and some may lead to developmental problems. 
STIs also increase your risk of giving birth too early or losing your baby.   
Some STIs are easy to treat. All of them can be managed if caught early. The clinic will screen you for STIs and help you manage them. The symptoms for STIs include a rash around your vagina or painful urination. 
But you can have an infection with no symptoms.  
This means you should always use a condom to help prevent STIs and HIV - even when pregnant.

<title>Smoking</title>
<body>When you breathe in smoke, it can lower your ability to fight illnesses. It can also cause your baby to be born weak and unhealthy. 
If you smoke, try to cut down or quit. It will be hard. Start by cutting down small amounts every day. If someone else in your family smokes, ask if they will cut down or stop with you. You will be able to support each other. If you are finding it really hard to cut down, talk to your clinic. They may be able to help you. You can even call the "Substance abuse" helpline on 0800121314. They will lend support as you try to quit.
If family members smoke in the house, ask them to smoke outside. 
Household smoke can also be harmful. If your house is smoky, get as much fresh air as possible. Opening the windows and doors will help. You could also try to get out of the house for some time. Why not go for a walk each day? This will refresh you.

<title>What can I do to cope with tiredness?</title>
<body>Listen to your body's signals. Try taking small naps or going to bed early.
At work, a short break or nap can help. Try to have a rest during the day. 
Try to adjust your day. If possible, arrange to go home early once in a while.
If you're already a mother, give yourself a break sometimes. Try to leave your children with someone else, so you can catch up on your sleep.
Try to make sure you're eating well. A diet made up of vegetables, fruits, cereals, milk, and lean meats can be energising. Food high in fats and sugar, by contrast, actually lowers your energy levels. 
Try to eat little and often. This will give you a constant flow of energy. It may help to ease your nausea and vomiting too. 
Make sure you take your daily iron pill. Not getting enough iron can make you feel worn out.
Hang in there! Soon enough you'll be over the worst with energy to spare again.

<title>What is this pulling pain around my bump?</title>
<body>It is quite normal for your lower belly to ache during pregnancy.
This aching will feel different to cramping. The ache is caused by the stretching of the muscles and ligaments that support your womb. Ligaments are the tough, flexible tissues that connect your bones.
Hormones produced by your body during pregnancy cause the stretching.
You will probably feel it when you're getting up from a bed or chair. Or you might feel it when you cough or when you get out of the bath.
This ache may be particularly painful in the later stages of pregnancy. You might feel it most when your baby's head moves down, ready to be born. This is called engaging.
You might be more likely to get this pain if have already given birth to a child and this is not your first pregnancy.

<title>When should I worry about dizziness?</title>
<body>Dizziness is common in pregnancy and is usually nothing to worry about.
Your greatest danger is of fainting. If you feel faint, lie down on your left side. Or sit with your head between your knees. These positions will help to make you feel better. 
You should go to the clinic if you faint or if you are often dizzy. You should also go to the clinic if you have pain in your lower belly, shortness of breath, blurred vision, palpitations, headaches, or vomiting. 
Dizziness can be caused by severe anaemia. It can also mean you're breathing too fast or too deeply. Or it may be caused by something unrelated to your pregnancy. 
Occasional fainting and dizziness may be caused by diabetes. You may have had this before you became pregnant. Or you may have developed the condition during pregnancy.
On rare occasions fainting and dizziness may suggest more serious problems. Bleeding from the placenta or an ectopic pregnancy can have these symptoms. If you are worried about dizziness and fainting, go to the clinic now.

<title>Social support</title>
<body>Mothers go through lots of different emotions when labour starts. Some are scared and worried, and others are very excited! All these feelings are normal. 
With all these emotions and changes happening to your body, it can really help to have someone you know and trust helping you through the early stages of labour. 
There are lots of things that a close friend or family member could do to help you.  A helper could:
- Massage your back when your contractions start
- Remind you to go to the toilet
- Talk to you and encourage you
- Fetch you water 
- Help get you ready to head to the clinic
Start thinking today about who you would like to be your supporter. Choose someone you trust. Make sure you pick someone who is nearby so that they can come to you whenever your labour starts. 
Explain to them what they could do to help you.
You don't have to go through your whole labour alone - having someone there will make you far more relaxed. This will help your labour to progress and can make it quicker.

<title>How many meals do I need to eat?</title>
<body>Even if you're not hungry, chances are your baby is, so try to eat regularly.
You might be feeling sick, or have found that you suddenly don't like the taste or smell of some foods. Heartburn or indigestion may make eating a chore. Try eating less, but more often. Five or six small meals may be easier.
Make your meals and snacks from a variety of foods. Fruits and vegetables are important. You can buy these fresh, frozen, tinned, dried or juiced. Aim for at least five portions each day.
Starchy foods, including bread, pap, samp, millets, mealies, sorghum and potatoes should be in each meal. They will give you energy.
Foods rich in protein will help your baby to grow. All kinds of meat, Mopani worms, insects, fish, beans and lentils are good. Dried beans, peanuts and soya are good too.
Dairy foods like milk, cheese and yoghurt will help your baby grow strong bones and teeth. Try to have some every day.

<title>Why do I have a rash?</title>
<body>Rashes and itches often come and go during pregnancy. Mostly there isn't any obvious cause. They are usually harmless.
Your hormone levels in pregnancy can make your skin make you more sensitive. You may find your washing powder or soap gives you a rash. Try to use less of it.
Getting too hot could also cause a rash. Try wearing light, loose cotton clothes to keep your body cool. 
Most rashes are harmless, but some could be signs of a problem. If you spot these signs, head to the clinic. The staff there will be able to give you the treatment you need:

<title>Is constipation ever serious?</title>
<body>You'll probably find constipation more of an annoyance than a major problem. But if it doesn't go away, mention it at the clinic so you can treat it early.
If it is very difficult for you to pass stools, this can sometimes lead to piles. These are swollen blood vessels that form in your lower back passage, or anus.
Piles can cause can cause itching, swelling and pain around your back passage. You might also see some bleeding, especially when you pass a stool.
Piles can be treated with creams and ointments. Ask the clinic for a cream that is safe to use in pregnancy. This cream will help soothe the area and make you more comfortable.
If you get bleeding from your anus that doesn't go away, go back to the clinic. The staff there will be able to find out what is wrong.
Thankfully, piles will usually shrink and stop causing you problems soon after your baby is born.

<title>Will thrush affect my baby?</title>
<body>No. Your baby is safely sealed inside your womb. He won't be affected at all.
If you have thrush when you go into labour, there is a small chance that your baby will catch it as he passes through your vagina on his way into the world.
If your newborn baby has thrush, you'll see white patches in his mouth. Both you and your baby will need treatment. Thrush can spread to your breasts, too, when your new baby feeds. It can make your nipples sore. Then both you and your baby will need treatment.
Thrush is a nuisance in pregnancy but it can't hurt your growing baby in the womb. All the same, it is best to get it treated. It can be uncomfortable and unpleasant for you.

<title>Why do I have a dark line on my tummy?</title>
<body>This dark line tends to appear in the middle of pregnancy. It is a normal part of being pregnant. Not everyone gets it, but many do.
You may see a line on your skin, which is darker than your usual skin colour. It runs up and down the middle of your belly. It often crosses your belly button. 
It is caused by the colour in the skin changing. It happens where your tummy muscles stretch and slightly separate, as your baby grows. Your line might be dark brown or black.
This line will fade within a few weeks of giving birth. You will notice that other darker areas of your skin - like your nipples, moles and freckles - may get darker too. They will all fade with time.
These skin changes are harmless. They are all part of your body's natural changes as your baby grows.

<title>Dealing with poor appetite</title>
<body>Pregnancy sickness can mean that you don't feel like eating much. Having HIV can also you make more likely to feel sick. Eating well is important for a healthy pregnancy. It will help you to recover from illness and will help you grow a healthy baby. 
Try having smaller meals more often. Break food down into small amounts and eat it throughout the day. This means that you don't have to force down a large, heavy meal in one sitting.
Indulge in your favourite foods. If you don't feel like eating much, any food you do eat will boost your energy levels.
Drinking high energy drinks can also keep you strong when you don't want to eat very much. Try drinking maas, full fat pasteurised milk and yoghurt or mageu.
If you are struggling to eat, talk to the clinic. They may be able to give you some medicine to help you.

<title>Could heartburn be something else?</title>
<body>It is unlikely if the burning pain is the only problem. Heartburn pain usually travels up behind your breastbone to your throat.
If you have a sharp pain in the top of your belly below your ribs on the right hand side, it could be a sign of a condition called pre-eclampsia. If you're not sure, go to the clinic for a check-up. The clinic will be able to tell you what's wrong.
If the pain is in the right upper side of your belly and you're vomiting, it could be caused by a liver problem related to your pregnancy. Again, you need to go to the clinic to be checked.
It is possible that you may have a digestive problem. It might not be related to pregnancy. A stomach ulcer can also give these symptoms.
If you are finding it difficult to eat, are losing weight or are worried about your symptoms, you need to be checked out at the clinic. The staff there will be able to help you and give you medicine.

<title>Hygiene - keeping kitchen clean</title>
<body>Being pregnant can make it easier for you to catch infections. You are also more vulnerable to infections if you are HIV+. It is important to keep yourself and your kitchen clean. Here are some simple steps:
Wash your hands with soap before you start to prepare meals, after using the toilet and after handling animals. 
If you have any animals in the house, keep them away from the kitchen. Animals can spread germs and make you sick. 
Clean your kitchen regularly. Keep your kitchen washing cloths and drying cloths clean and dry. Change them regularly and boil them to get rid of germs. 
Wash dishes and cooking areas with soapy water. 
Make sure food is always fresh. Cook enough food for the family every day. Throw away unused food. 
Store uncooked food, like fruit, vegetables and bread, in a cool cupboard so it doesn't spoil. And always throw rotten food away. 
Following these steps will go a long way towards keeping germs away from your kitchen.

<title>What can I do about high blood pressure?</title>
<body>The more overweight you are, the more likely you are to get high blood pressure while you're pregnant.
If you were overweight before pregnancy, try to limit the amount of weight you put on. Putting on lots more weight is not good for you or your baby. As well as high blood pressure, you could develop diabetes. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, and cut down on fatty and sugary foods.
Take the calcium tablets that the clinic gives you. You need to take them every day. The clinic may also give you a special form of aspirin if you are at high risk of getting pre-eclampsia. You need to take these tablets every day as well.
It's important to spot high blood pressure early. Then you and your baby can be treated.
This is why you need to go to all your check-ups. The clinic will measure your blood pressure each time. You won't be able to tell by yourself if your blood pressure has gone too high.

<title>Coping with diarrhoea</title>
<body>Being pregnant makes you more at risk of having infections like diarrhoea. Having HIV also means that you often experience diarrhoea. This makes your body lose fluids quickly and can leave you feeling weak. 
If you have diarrhoea, you need to get plenty of food and fluids. Make sure you drink lots of fluids between meals. These can be clean water, soup or fruit juice. 
You need to make sure you replace the salts you are losing. Potatoes, bananas and spanspek are all good foods to stock up on.  
Starchy foods such as potato, rice and porridge will give you lots of energy and are easy to digest. 
Try not to have milk or milk powder while you have diarrhoea. It can make it worse. Yoghurt, maas and buttermilk are better options. 
Don't have any tea, coffee or alcohol. They can stop you from feeling hungry.
You may find it easier to have small meals scattered throughout the day.
If your diarrhoea does not improve in a few days - go to the clinic. Don't wait until you are very weak. The staff at the clinic will give you treatment that will help you recover quickly.

Use mild soaps to cleanse your skin. Harsh soaps and strongly perfumed ones may make your skin more itchy. Add a bag of oats to your water when you have a bath. To make one, put a couple of handfuls of oats in a pillowcase or a pair of old pantihose and hang this on the bath taps so the water runs through it. The oats will give off a milky white liquid that is very soothing to itchy skin. 
Dry your skin carefully especially in the skin creases around your breasts and under your bump. Use a moisturizer such as cocoa butter after a bath or shower.
If you have eczema, ask at the clinic for some balms or creams that are safe to use in pregnancy.
Try not to get too hot. Heat rash can make itching worse. So wear loose cotton clothing and stay indoors or in the shade if it's really hot.

<title>I've gone off sex</title>
<body>The big changes in your body when you get pregnant are sure to alter your sex life.
Some women feel sexier. But you may just feel too tired or sick to want sex, especially in the first three months. What's normal for one person may not be the same for you.
Your pregnancy hormones could be one reason why you don't feel very sexy.
Your state of mind is another. If you feel happy about your pregnancy and the changes in your body, you're likely to feel in the mood. But if you're not very happy, or you are worried about your growing tummy or other issues, this can put you off.
As you get near to birth, labour and your belly loom large. You might just not feel attractive or you might be worried about whether your partner is happy.
You might feel most sexy in the middle of your pregnancy.
If you don't feel in the mood, don't force yourself. Try and find other ways to be intimate with your partner, such as having a cuddle or a massage.

<title>Can breathlessness harm my baby?</title>
<body>Feeling breathless is normal during pregnancy. It won't harm your baby if you haven't got any other worrying symptoms.
Rest assured that you're actually breathing deeply and efficiently. Your baby is getting what he needs, even if it doesn't feel like it.
But, if you do have other symptoms, it is best to go to the clinic. You may need treatment.

<title>HIV and Pneumonia</title>
<body>If you are HIV+ you are more at risk of getting Pneumonia. A fever, chest pain and a cough with mucus are signs of pneumonia. It can make you very ill. If you spot these signs, go to the clinic. You can get the right treatment there. You will probably start feeling better in a couple of days, but you will still need to finish the medicine. Take all the doses to make a full recovery. 
There are things you can do to help prevent illnesses like pneumonia. Keep yourself strong by taking your HIV medication. This will help you to fight illnesses and infections better.
Smoking or being in a smoke-filled room can make it easier to get pneumonia. If you smoke, try cutting down. Do this slowly over a period of time. If members of your family smoke, ask them to smoke outside. Try explaining to them how it will keep you and your baby healthy. 
If your home has lots of smoke during cooking, try opening doors and windows. 
You may  also be able to protect yourself by getting a flu injection. Ask at the clinic for it.

<title>Walking is uncomfortable. It feels like my baby is coming out</title>
<body>As your baby grows, he settles into place ready for birth. Usually, his head is lowest. At the end of pregnancy, his head will move down lower.
If this is your first baby, he may stay quite high up until just before he is born. This is OK. Your muscles are strong and are holding him up. Once labour starts, the power of your contractions will push him down.
If your baby has dropped down you may feel as if he is coming out. It can feel like you have a soccer ball between your legs. 
When this happens, you will have more room to breathe. You might need to urinate more often though.
If you have had a baby before, this baby might move down sooner than your first one.  It just means that your muscles are less strong.
Sometimes your baby can find it hard to get into this head-down position. He might be lying with his back to yours, or across your tummy. He might keep changing his mind. If your baby doesn't settle, the clinic may talk to you about having a caesarean.

<title>What are practice contractions?</title>
<body>Your womb has been contracting gently since about two months. The bigger your womb gets, the more you notice the tightening feelings when they happen. Each tightening usually lasts for about half a minute.
If you feel a tightening, place your hands on your bare bump. You can feel how hard your womb becomes. This is because it is a muscle and when a muscle tenses it gets hard. 
Practice contractions are usually felt in the middle of pregnancy, but sometimes women experience them as early as four months. 
Practice contractions probably won't cause you any discomfort. You may have this sensation once or twice an hour, a few times a day. Not all women feel these practice contractions. They are still happening, but they are just not strong enough for you to feel them.
Practice contractions may be a sign that your womb is keeping itself toned. You are ready and in good condition for labour.
These contractions may come more often when you do light activity, such as carrying the shopping. If they become uncomfortable, it sometimes helps to lie down or have a warm bath. Some women find it helps to walk around.  Practice relaxing and breathing through the contractions, so you know how to cope with the real thing when you are in labour.

<title>Sexual violence and depression</title>
<body>Having a baby is exciting and challenging. But that doesn't mean it's not stressful. You probably have had to make lots of adjustments. This can leave you run down and stressed. Some women even feel unhappy about their pregnancy and feel they are not ready to have a baby.
This is not uncommon. Lots of women feel this way.
Sometimes all you need is to talk to somebody. Sharing your worries and stresses can make them easier to deal with.
Why not try talking to your mum or a relative? Sometimes talking to other mothers also helps. Find out how they coped. 
Talk to your partner to see if he can help. Maybe together you can find time for you to sit quietly and relax. 
Share your questions and worries with a health worker at the clinic. She is there to help you be a mother. 
You can even call Lifeline on 0117281347. They will support you through your pregnancy. 
If your partner or anyone hits or yells at you, you have the right to seek help. Call 0800 150 150. It's a 24 hour "Stop Gender Violence" helpline.

<title>Caesarean birth</title>
<body>Sometimes it's best for mother and baby when the baby is born by caesarean. A caesarean, or c-section, is an operation. A cut is made in your stomach and the baby is delivered through the cut. You will be asleep during the operation or you may have an injection in your spine to numb your body.  
Some caesareans are planned. Sometimes the clinic decides it is safer for you and you're your baby once you are into labour.
Find out why you may need a caesarean and what happens during the operation and afterwards:

<body>If this is your first baby you may not be sure whether you are in labour or not. Usually if you have had a baby before you do know, because you remember how you felt last time. But if you are trying to decide if now s the time to go to the clinic, this checklist may help. 
Do you have a pain in your lower back or low down on your tummy?
Do you have a crampy feeling as if you are about to start your period? 
Have you had a show?  A brownish or blood-tinged mucus discharge?
Are you having contractions that are getting longer and stronger?
Have your waters gone? 
If you see some of these signs it means that you are in early labour and you should plan to go to the clinic soon.

<title>Early labour</title>
<body>In early labour, your cervix begins to open so that your baby can be born. By the end of the first stage, the neck of your womb (your cervix) will be open to about 10cm wide.
First, your cervix has to shorten and soften. Feel your nose: it is firm. Now feel your lips: they're soft and stretchy. Your cervix starts out firm like your nose. It becomes soft and stretchy like your lips. 
Your cervix starts to open and widen. You may not notice this starting. Your womb may be contracting very gently. It might feel like the cramps you get with your period.
As time passes, you will be getting increasingly painful contractions. They'll start to come regularly. These are different to practice contractions (Braxton Hicks), which are irregular and less painful. 
Everybody's labour is different. But usually, early contractions are more than five minutes apart and short, perhaps only 30 or 40 seconds long. They won't bother you much yet. 
For some women, early labour starts and stops. For others, it moves smoothly into active labour.

<title>When should I go to the clinic if I'm swelling up?</title>
<body>Getting swollen ankles and hands is very common in pregnancy. It starts gradually in the last three months of pregnancy.
If you have sudden or severe swelling in your face, hands or feet, this is different.
It could be a sign of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition for you and your baby.
You might have other symptoms as well. You may have a bad headache. Your vision may be blurred or you might see flashing lights. You might have a pain just below your ribs on your right side.
You need to ask someone to take you straight to the clinic. You and your baby need to be checked. If you have pre-eclampsia you might need to go to hospital. Your baby might need to be born early.

<title>Planning ahead for birth</title>
<body>As your baby's arrival gets closer, it's time to start making plans for the birth. At a clinic there will be help at hand in case there are complications. So it's best to have your baby at the clinic. 
When labour starts, you will have to leave quickly. It's a good idea to work out how long it will take to get to the clinic well beforehand. Talk with your family and make plans for how to get there and who will go with you. 
It's also a good idea to have someone with your during the early stages of labour. This will help you relax and manage labour. Choose someone you trust.  
Ask at the clinic what things you will need to take with you. Gather them before birth.  
If your waters break or you begin to have contractions, go to the clinic. If you have HIV it's even more important for you to go to the clinic right away. 
Even if you're not too sure you're in labour, go. It's better to be safe than sorry.

<title>Why breast is best even if you are  HIV+</title>
<body>When your baby is here he will need lots of food to grow. The best food for him is your breastmilk.  Your milk is full of goodness that is perfect for your baby. It has all he needs to grow big and strong. It can also help to protect him from some diseases. 
By giving your baby only breastmilk, you can help give him the best start in life.  
Take advantage of your precious milk and let your baby have it as often as he wants. Let him feed until he has had enough. This means that he will get more of your hind milk. Your hind milk has the most goodness. It will keep him healthy and happy.
If you are HIV+, give your baby his ARVs every day.
You can significantly reduce the risk of passing on HIV to your baby by feeding him only breastmilk and his ARV pills every day.

<title>What do contractions feel like?</title>
<body>Most women say that, at first, contractions feel very much like period pains. They may be crampy pains low down under your bump. As labour progresses they may feel more like pulling pains under your bump as the cervix begins to stretch and open. 
 Some women feel them mostly in their back as a tightening or intense pressure in the lower back. 
What contractions have in common is that they come and go at regular intervals, and they gradually get longer and stronger.   You can feel a contraction starting. You can feel it building up, getting stronger and more intense until it reaches a peak and then it gradually fades away. They may last 30-40 seconds at first and come every 15 or 20 minutes. Then they get closer together and last longer, so in strong labour they may be coming every 5 or 6 minutes and lasting 50-60 seconds. 
This pattern is very useful as you can rest between contractions, or do things like pack your bag. In the early stages you will be able to talk through contractions. You can probably smile and joke with people and  answer questions, even during a contraction.   As they get longer and stronger you will find you need to stop and breathe through the contractions. You won't be able to talk through them, but you will be able to chat after one finishes.  Once they get very strong, you may find that you come out in a sweat during the contraction and feel quite shaky. You may find it very hard to talk to people even during the rests. 
If you have a long journey to the clinic make sure you set off in the early stages, so that you get to the clinic safely before you feel the pushing urge that tells you the baby is on its way.

<title>What to take to the clinic in labour</title>
<body>Labour can take you by surprise. It's important that you get to the clinic as soon as labour starts. This is particularly important if you have HIV.
It's a good idea to gather all the essentials you'll need during labour and birth. 
Being prepared will avoid stress later on.
Here are a few items that you will need to take with you when you go to the clinic for labour.
<ul>
<li>a change of clothes</li>
<li>a towel</li>
<li>toothbrush</li>
<li>toothpaste</li>
<li>soap</li>
<li>sanitary pads</li>
<li>your ARV pills, if you have HIV</li>
</ul>
You will also need to take some items for your baby.
<ul>
<li>clothes</li>
<li>a hat to cover your baby's head</li>
<li>nappies</li>
<li>a soft towel to clean your baby</li>
<li>a soft blanket to wrap your baby</li>
</ul>
Being prepared will help make sure you have a stress-free labour and birth.

<title>How long will labour last?</title>
<body>No one can say how long your labour will last. Everyone is different.
If you can keep upright and move around in labour, this may help everything to happen more quickly.
For your first baby, labour may take about eight hours. But it could be much shorter or much longer. It's unlikely to last more than 18 hours. Once the neck of your womb (your cervix) has opened fully, it could take you one or two hours of pushing before your baby is born. 
If you've had a baby before, it will probably be much quicker this time around. About five hours is common. It is unlikely to last more than 12 hours. It may only take you around ten minutes to push your baby out. 
After your baby is born, you push the placenta out. This takes from five to 15 minutes. But it can take up to an hour. 
Very occasionally, labour can happen really fast. This is more likely if you've had a baby before. It's important to trust your instincts. Listen to what your body is telling you, so that you can get help in time. Some babies just can't wait!

It tends to happen in the second half of pregnancy. It is more common in women having their first baby. But if you had it in a previous pregnancy you are more at risk. If you also have swelling, headaches or a pain below your ribs on your right side go to the clinic straightaway.

<title>My partner has gone off sex</title>
<body>Your partner may not seem any different in the first part of pregnancy. But he may begin to feel less like making love in the last three months, as you grow bigger.
This doesn't usually mean that he doesn't want you anymore.
Your partner might be worried that sex can hurt the baby. Or, he might have worries about you and your unborn baby's health. He could also be feeling worried about becoming a father. Sometimes fathers-to-be feel shy about having sex in the presence of your unborn baby.
Talk to your partner about his fears. It may help to explain that making love while you are pregnant won't hurt you or your baby. You could also try being intimate with your partner in other ways, such as having a massage or cuddle.

<title>Importance of colostrum</title>
<body>The first milk you make is very thick and creamy-coloured. It is called colostrum. Sometimes you may find this yellowy milk leaking from your breasts. 
Colostrum is rich in nutrients and antibodies. Save this precious gift for your baby as soon as he is born, within the first hour. It will give your baby the best protection. Feeding him anything else is harmful and a waste of your special milk. Breastfeed instead. It will be worth it.
If you have HIV then your baby will need to take ARVs along with your breast milk. The ARVs will protect him from getting HIV and you will need to feed them to him every day. 
If you have any questions, ask at the clinic.

<title>Why might I need an emergency caesarean birth?</title>
<body>An emergency caesarean is one that happens after labour starts. Sometimes, clinic staff will move fast to operate so your baby can be born safely.
If you are not already in hospital, you will be moved there for the operation.
There are many reasons why you may suddenly need an operation.
You may need one if the umbilical cord slips through 'the neck of the womb (the cervix) ahead of your baby. There's a danger the cord will be squashed during birth. It could cut off your baby's oxygen supply.
If your labour is very long and slow, the cervix may not be opening enough to allow your baby to come out. This may also mean that you need an operation.
You might need a caesarean if your placenta moves during labour too. This could be harmful to your baby and can cause heavy bleeding.
Another reason is that your baby may become distressed during labour. Or you may have heavy bleeding. A caesarean is the safest option if this happens.

<title>How can I cope with pain in labour?</title>
<body>Labour is different for everyone, and nobody can say how it will feel for you. You may find that labour is bearable, or that you have to cope for quite long time with long and strong contractions. So it's worth thinking about some ways to help yourself in labour. 
Warmth is a popular way of relaxing aching and tense muscles. 'It is 'a very effective way of providing relief from labour pain.
A hot water bottle filled with hot (but not boiling) water is soothing. Take care to wrap the bottle in a towel or soft cover before you use it.
Massage, particularly a back rub, will warm your skin and help relax your muscles. 
A warm bath will soothe your aching back during contractions. The warm water will relax you and help you to store up energy for labour.
Move around and try different positions to see which are most comfortable for you.

<title>How do I cope with pelvic pain?</title>
<body>The pain may be worse at night. If you find turning over in bed painful, try sitting up first. Tighten all your tummy muscles and pull your knees up to do this. 
Try not to lie on your back or sit with straight legs. If you do lie on your back, place a rolled towel under your back, and bend your knees.
When you are walking, arch your back and swing your arms. This will help relieve strain.
Move little and often and get plenty of rest. You could try resting on your hands and knees. It is also best if you don't do any heavy lifting. This will add to the strain on your pelvis.
When dressing, sit down to pull on your panties or trousers, don't try to do it standing up!
It's best not to lie on your back to give birth. Upright or kneeling positions are better. If you have to sit on the bed during labour, sit upright. This makes parting your legs easier.
Don't push through any pain. If something hurts, don't do it.

<title>Managing labour pain</title>
<body>It's normal for you to feel some pain in labour. This is your body's way of telling you what's going on. Some women find it more painful than others. It's good to prepare yourself to be able to cope with labour pain. 
Here are some ways to help control the pain:
<ul>
<li>Being upright and moving around or leaning over a chair or table</li>
<li>Breathing calmly and deeply during a contraction; at the start of the contraction give a little sigh out, then breathe steadily, say to yourself 'sigh-out-slowly'</li>
<li>A warm bath or shower</li>
<li>Putting cloths wrung out in hot water on your lower back</li>
<li>Having someone hold your hand during the pain</li>
<li>Having someone to rub your back firmly</li>
</ul>
What makes the pain worse? 
<ul>
<li>Lying down</li>
<li>Being afraid and tense</li>
<li>Holding your breath</li>
<li>Having to talk during a contraction</li>
<li>Someone telling you what to do, when you want to listen to your body and do what feels right</li>
<li>Being on your own</li>
<li>Being cold and hungry</li>
</ul>
Try to make sure you have a friend or your partner with you in early labour when you are at home. Have something to eat and drink, and keep warm.

<title>Strong labour</title>
<body>As labour goes on, your contractions become longer and more frequent.
You've moved into the strong, active phase of labour. Contractions in strong labour open the neck of your womb (your cervix) more rapidly. Contractions are much stronger now. They usually start gradually and build up to a peak, before fading away. You probably won't be able to talk through these contractions. You may have to stop and breathe through them. Try some breathing techniques to help you keep calm and avoid panic.
Contractions may come as often as every three to four minutes and last 60 to 90 seconds. Between contractions, you'll be able to talk and move around. Relax and prepare yourself for the next one. 
You can have a drink or something to eat. 
Listen to your body and try different positions to stay comfortable.
Empty your bladder often.
Take a warm shower or bath to ease the pain.

<title>Can walking during labour help?</title>
<body>You might think that you'll be most comfortable lying on the bed. But, keeping as upright as you can and walking around will help your labour. Movement will help you and your baby to cope.
You could go on a gentle walk to distract you from the pain. You could just walk around your house. You might play with your other children. Be careful not to tire yourself though.
If you get really tired and bed seems like the best place to be, use pillows or wedges to lie down on your side. Remember that contractions can be more painful in horizontal positions, so try to rest only if you're very tired.
If you feel rested after a little while, push yourself up with your hands into a sitting position and get into a comfortable upright position again.

<body>If the leaking fluid is just a small trickle every now and then, it may be urine. About a third of pregnant women will experience this at some point. It can often happen in late pregnancy. Doing pelvic floor exercises can help.
But, leaking fluid could also be your waters breaking. The waters may break as a trickle, but sometimes this happens with a gush. You can usually tell if the waters go with a gush as there is so much fluid. You may need to hold a towel or thick cloth between your legs to catch the waters. 
If fluid is leaking, you need to find out if it is urine or your waters.  Put a pad on for an hour. If the fluid is clear with a yellow tinge and has no smell, it is your waters. 
If your waters have broken you will have less protection from infection. Go to the clinic as soon as you can. Your baby may need to be born quickly. Go to the clinic if you think your waters have gone.

<title>Keeping baby warm and ready to feed</title>
<body>When your baby is born, he suddenly finds himself in a world that is much colder than your warm womb. Babies can't adjust to the new temperature and tend to lose heat very quickly. So it's important to keep your baby warm as soon as he is born.
When your baby is born, he will be wet, so make sure he is dried. 
Ask the staff to lay him on your bare chest. Your warmth will help prevent your baby getting too cold. Hold him firmly so he doesn't slip and fall. Lay a clean, warm blanket over both of you. This will keep the heat in. You can make a sling to keep him safe. Also put a small hat or a cloth wrapper over his head. Babies lose a lot of heat through their heads. 
Keeping your baby warm through skin-to-skin contact will also give you and your baby time to get to know each other. You can see who has been kicking you all this time! Holding your baby this way will also mean that you and your baby will be ready to breastfeed.

<title>I'm not sure if my waters have broken - what do I do?</title>
<body>Sometimes, your waters can break before the end of pregnancy. It can happen in the last month of pregnancy, before your due date.
A small trickle of fluid might just be urine leaking. This can happen in late pregnancy. You'll probably recognise the smell. The waters surrounding your baby don't smell but your urine does.
Put on a sanitary pad. This will protect you and you will be able to see the colour of the fluid. Your waters are almost clear and a bit yellow. They may be a little bloodstained to begin with. 
No matter how many weeks pregnant you are when your waters break, you should go straight to the clinic. This is because you are open to infection now your waters have gone. This could harm you and the baby. You both need to be checked and you might need treatment.
Your labour might start naturally once your waters have broken. Depending on what the clinic finds, you might need to go to hospital for your labour to be induced. Your baby might need to be born early.

<title>What positions help in labour?</title>
<body>When you are in strong labour, you will probably find that you don't want to move around very much. You'll need your strength to cope with each contraction as it comes. You will naturally find the position that suits you best.
You could lean on a work surface, the back of a chair, a bed or a windowsill. 
You could also try sitting on a chair with a pillow, or kneeling on a pillow and leaning forwards onto a chair seat.
Try putting your arms round your partner's neck or waist and leaning on him. Perhaps ask your partner to massage your back with each contraction.
You could also kneel on all fours, or kneel on one leg with the other bent. 
Try rocking your hips backwards and forwards or in a circle. This helps your baby through your pelvis and is comforting. Just keep rocking, leaning forwards during contractions and straightening up in between.

<title>I haven't felt my baby kick today - should I be worried?</title>
<body>If you are busy, you may not have noticed your baby's movements.
Babies sometimes sleep while you are moving around and may wake up when you stop. Lie down on your side and stay still. This will help you focus on your baby's movements.
 Have a cold drink. Your baby may feel the change in temperature and respond to it. Make some noise. Play loud music or slam a door to see if he reacts.
 If your baby starts to move then all is probably well. Keep an eye on his movements. Go to the clinic if your baby doesn't move in response to noise or temperature change. Go if there is a big decrease in your baby's movements in one day, or gradually over several days.
A decrease in your baby's movements could mean he's not getting enough nutrients or oxygen.
The clinic can check your baby to see how he's doing. It will give you peace of mind. Go if you are worried.

<title>The birth of your baby</title>
<body>Once your cervix is fully open, you can push your baby out.
You'll feel the pressure of your baby's head between your legs. With each contraction you may get two or three strong urges to push. Listen to your body and push when you get a strong urge. With every push, your baby will move down a little. Try not to hold your breath when you're pushing.
At the end of the contraction, he'll slip back a bit. Don't worry. As long as your baby keeps on moving a little further each time, you're doing fine. When your baby's head is far down, you'll probably feel a hot, stinging sensation. This will happen as the opening of your vagina starts to stretch around your baby's head.
The clinic sister or doctor will tell you when she can see your baby's head. She may ask you to stop pushing and take short, panting breaths for the next two or three contractions. This helps make sure that your baby is born gently and slowly. It helps you avoid tearing.

<title>Cord care - planning</title>
<body>When your baby is born, he will be attached to you by a cord. This needs to be cut. Giving birth at the clinic means you can have the cord cut in a hygienic way that doesn't cause infections. 
After the cord is cut, it's very important to keep it clean and dry until the stump drops off. Don't put anything on the stump as it may get infected. It will heal on its own. 
Don't bathe your baby for the first six hours of his life. When you do, use warm water. See that it's not too hot or cold. Dry him well. Keep him wrapped up and his head covered too. 
Take your baby to the clinic If the cord stump is red, bleeding or smells. These are signs of an infection. 
If you have any questions about how to look after your baby's cord stump, talk to the clinic. They will be able to guide you.

<title>Caring for a premature baby</title>
<body>Most babies are born in the ninth month. But it is common for babies to be born a few weeks before. With extra special care, babies born early have a good chance of growing up healthily. 
Giving your baby breastmilk is one of the best things you can do to build up his health. The first milk you make is very thick, creamy and full of goodness. Give your baby this precious gift.
Your baby may not be strong enough to feed at your breast. Feed him by expressing your milk into a sterilised cup. Hold him on your lap. Gently tilt the cup so it touches his lower lip and a little milk enters his mouth. Your baby will learn to start lapping the milk. 
Use a cup rather than a bottle, because a cup is easier to keep clean and the risk of infection will be less.
Your baby will also need lots of warmth. Keep him firmly strapped between your bare breasts to give him warmth from your body. 
Wearing a sling helps to make sure he's securely placed. This will comfort him, help you both bond, and will also help him develop. It will also help you to produce breastmilk.

<title>I have backache and cramps - is this labour?</title>
<body>A pain in your lower back that won't go away could be the start of labour. Many women have a 'backache labour'. You feel most of the contractions in your back, and get a strong feeling of pressure which increases at regular intervals.  Try leaning forward over a chair or kneeling down with your head and shoulders on a sofa or armchair.  This can ease the pain of backache labour. A cloth dipped in hot water and then wrung out and placed on your back can help with the pain as well. 
Backache labours occur more often with first time mothers and it can mean that labour is quite long and slow. So make sure you rest when you can, and that you eat and drink little and often to keep your energy levels up.  You may find that the pain gradually moves round to the front of your bump, with strong pulling pains under your bump. This is a sign that things are moving quite quickly and it's time to head for the clinic.

<title>Why does moving around help in labour?</title>
<body>When your labour starts, you'll probably feel quite restless. You'll want to move around and keep busy. Just take care that you don't get over-tired before your labour has fully started. Have short rests in a chair or lying down. If your contractions start at night, try to stay in bed and relax for as long as possible.
Keeping upright will help your labour to progress. It will help you and your baby to cope better. 
Upright positions help make your contractions efficient and controlled. It can also help lessen the pain of the contractions. It will be easier for your birth partner to massage your back too.
If you are upright rather than lying down, this can help push your baby's head down on to the cervix. This helps your cervix to open and allows your baby to move through your pelvis.

<title>Delivering the afterbirth</title>
<body>Once your baby is born, you deliver the afterbirth, called the placenta. Contractions will begin again, but they are weaker this time. The placenta will gradually peel away from the wall of your womb.
Hold your new baby next to your skin. Offer your breast as soon as possible. This will increase your contractions to make the placenta separate. It may be easier to push your placenta out if you are upright.
The placenta, and the empty bag of waters, will drop to the bottom of your womb. They pass out through your vagina.
You may have an injection of a drug. This helps the placenta detach itself from your womb. It speeds up the third stage and you won't have to do much pushing.
Your midwife will examine the placenta. She needs to make sure that nothing has been left behind. She will feel your tummy to check that your womb is contracting hard. This stops the bleeding from the place where the placenta was attached.

<title>Benefits of vaccination, your child's first Polio and TB</title>
<body>When your baby is born, he will not be strong enough to fight illnesses.
Vaccinations help protect your baby from certain diseases. They work by creating antibodies in your baby's body, which can fight germs if they enter your baby's body. Vaccinations do not cure him once he gets the illnesses. So it's important to get your baby vaccinated at the right time.  
Vaccines can come in several doses. Your baby needs to take all the doses at the right times. Only then will he get the best protection vaccines offer.
Over the course of his first year, starting from the day he is born, he will be vaccinated against diseases like tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B, rotavirus and measles.
When he is born, he will be vaccinated against TB and given the first dose of the polio vaccine. This will come in the form of drops and an injection. 
Your baby may be upset for a little while after the injection. Breastfeed your baby soon afterwards. This will help to comfort him. You will feel better too.

If you have a headache and blurred vision, a pain high up under your ribs on the right hand side, vomiting and sudden swelling of your face, hands or feet, you need help fast.
These can be signs of a condition called pre-eclampsia. 
If you have these signs, you need someone to drive you to the clinic straight away. Don't wait. The clinic will be able to give you the treatment you need.
Pre-eclampsia can be dangerous for you and your baby. It can only be treated at the clinic.

These are your scheduled visits. But in some cases, you will need to take him to the clinic right away, like:
If your baby's tummy is too cold or too hot
If he develops yellow eyes, hands and feet within the first day of his life
If he refuses to feed or sucks poorly
If he won't stop crying or if his cry sounds unusual
If he has a fit, is lethargic, or has bluish skin or nails
If he is wheezing, grunting, or breathing quickly 
If he is vomiting after every feed for more than a day, or has a swollen stomach
If the area around your baby's cord stump is red or smelly, It may be infected
These are signs that your baby is unwell, and needs treatment quickly.

<title>What foods are high in iron</title>
<body>There are two sorts of iron-rich foods. Red meat, fish and chicken contain iron that is easily used by your body. Foods such as beans and peas, dried fruit, wholegrain bread and green leafy vegetables contain iron that is harder for your body to absorb.
Vitamin C helps your body to absorb the iron you get from food. Try drinking a glass of orange juice with your morning meal. Or have oranges, naartjies, grapefruits and lemons. All these fruits contain Vitamin C.
You could also combine fruit or vegetables that are rich in Vitamin C with iron-rich foods in the dishes you cook.
Tea and coffee contain substances that make it harder for your body to absorb iron. Try to drink something else with your meal.

<title>Will anaemia affect my baby?</title>
<body>Severe anaemia can affect how your baby grows. Your baby can be very weak and may be born too early. 
Anaemia can make you feel very tired and breathless. You may also bleed more heavily after the birth. This is why it is important to go to the clinic and have your iron levels measured. Taking iron tablets in pregnancy can make you feel better, help your baby grow well and prevent heavy bleeding after the birth.

<title>How is anaemia treated?</title>
<body>If your iron levels are low the clinic will give you iron tablets to take each day. Your iron tablets are important. 
 Take them with a glass of orange or lemon juice. This helps your body to absorb the iron. They may have some side effects like constipation or nausea, but you prevent these by taking them with food and having plenty to drink.
If you have trouble passing stools, try to eat foods that are high in fibre, such as wholegrain cereals and grains, fruit and vegetables. Your clinic may also be able to give you a gentle laxative that is safe to take in pregnancy.
If you feel a bit sick when you take the iron tablets try taking them just after a meal. Having some food in your stomach can prevent the iron making you feel sick.
The iron tablets may make your stools darker than usual and appear black, but this is not a sign of any problem.

<title>How will I know whether I am having practice contractions or real contractions?</title>
<body>There are differences between practice (or Braxton Hicks) contractions and labour contractions that can help you tell them apart.
Practice contractions only happen once or twice an hour, a few times a day. They usually last 'less than a minute. They are irregular - if they are regular they don't stay that way for long. This also means that they don't have a rhythm and don't get stronger.
They often stop if you change activity. So, walk around if you've been sitting. Rest if you've been active.
Labour contractions are usually longer and more regular. They are also more frequent and painful. They keep on going, and get longer and more painful as time goes on.
As your pregnancy progresses, practice contractions may become stronger. They may hurt at times. When this happens, they may feel like the real thing. But however strong they feel at the time, if they ease off, they are probably only practice contractions.
It may help to try the breathing exercises that you are going to use in labour.
If your contractions become longer, stronger, more regular and more frequent then your labour may be starting.

<title>How does breathing help in labour?</title>
<body>When you are tense and frightened, your breathing becomes shallow and fast. Your shoulders are pulled up towards your ears. Your neck and shoulder muscles feel tight and rigid.
If you are very scared, you may start panic breathing. Short, shallow, fast breathing cuts down on the amount of oxygen you take in for yourself and for your baby. You feel light-headed and out of control. Your fingers will start to tingle and your mouth feels numb.
Panic breathing is a common reaction to very stressful or frightening situations. It is normal, but your body can't continue in this state for long without getting very tired. In labour, you need to save your energy as much as possible. Your baby needs plenty of oxygen to help him cope with the stress of being born. Rhythmic breathing can help you do this.

<title>How can I breathe through a contraction?</title>
<body>Close your eyes for a moment and focus on your breathing - it has a rhythm, a steady in and out. 
When you are in pain 'its usual to hold your breath, or take short shallow breaths. That's fine if you stub your toe or cut yourself as it just lasts a few minutes.  In labour controlling your breathing helps make sure you get plenty of oxygen and stops you tensing up.
Contractions start small, get more intense, build to a peak and then fade away. So when you feel a contraction starting, take a little breath and then sigh out. This relaxes your body. Then take steady deep breaths. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Listen to the sound of your out breath. Make it a sigh out.  Focus on just controlling your breathing until the contraction fades away.  
Concentrating on your breathing may feel strange to begin with, but it really helps you to save energy and keep calm during labour.

<title>Why can my breathing help me in labour?</title>
<body>Breathing techniques can help you cope with the pain of labour. When you breathe out, you automatically relax your body.  Try giving a deep sigh out. Your shoulders drop, your chest relaxes and the muscles in your neck and face relax as well. 
When you are tense you use more energy, and you feel more pain. So relaxing and using your breathing to help you stay relaxed helps you cope with contractions.  
Your womb is a muscle. In fact it's now the biggest muscle in your body.  It needs energy to work properly. If all the muscles in your body are tense you will use up all your energy very quickly. So by relaxing the rest of your body, you make sure that the womb has all the energy it needs for labour. And you also make sure that your baby gets plenty of oxygen. 
Focus on breathing out slowly and smoothly. Breathing in will take care of itself. '' Try to breathe in to a count of three and out to a count of four.
Or you could try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep your mouth very soft as you breathe out. You might find it helpful to make a sound as you breathe out. Try 'oooooooh' or 'aaaaaah'. Remember to sip water in between contractions, so your mouth doesn't get dry.

<title>Can being breathless mean that something is wrong?</title>
<body>Some shortness of breath is common and normal during pregnancy. But go to the clinic straight away if you notice any of the following symptoms as well.
Pay attention to your heartbeat. If it is racing, feels irregular or is missing a beat, go to the clinic. This is known as palpitations.
If you feel faint or get severe breathlessness after a burst of activity, or even when lying down at night, you need to go to the clinic. You should also go to the clinic if you experience any chest pain, especially if it starts when you exert yourself.
Breathlessness can be a sign that the iron levels in your blood are low. You could be anaemic. Go to the clinic for a blood test.
If you have asthma, discuss it at the clinic. Controlling your asthma is important during pregnancy.

<title>Why do I need a planned caesarean birth?</title>
<body>A planned caesarean is one that happens before your labour begins. It's unusual for your clinic to suggest a planned caesarean birth, but there are reasons why they might. 
If you've already had two or more caesarean sections you may need it again this time. You may also need one if you have an infection that could be passed on to your baby if you give birth naturally. Heart disease or diabetes may also mean that it is safer for you to have an operation.
If your baby is in the wrong position or keeps moving, he won't come out easily on his own. A caesarean could solve this problem.
An operation will also be needed if you have severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. It could be dangerous to delay the birth.
If your baby is not growing as well as he should be in your womb, he might need to be born quickly . A low-lying placenta could also mean that you need a caesarean. It could get in the way of a normal birth and cause bleeding.

<title>What happens during the operation?</title>
<body>You may be asleep during the operation and wake up a few hours later to be shown your baby. If you have an injection to numb your body you will be awake while the operation happens, and will see your baby as soon as he is delivered. A screen is put up over your chest so you can't see what's happening. 
Once you're asleep or numb, your doctor will make a cut into the skin of your lower belly. 
The cut to your womb is usually small. Your doctor will make it bigger using scissors or fingers, so that it is torn. This causes less bleeding than a sharp cut. 
You may hear and sense fluid flowing out through the opening. The doctor will lift out your baby. You may feel someone pressing on your belly to help your baby be born. 
This all happens quickly. It may only be five or ten minutes after arriving in the operating theatre before you meet your baby. 
Surgeons may sometimes make a larger cut down the middle of your womb. They do this is your baby needs to be born very quickly.  It usually takes longer to be stitched up after the operation than it took to deliver your baby.

<title>How will I feel after the operation?</title>
<body>A caesarean can hurt a lot afterwards. You may feel you can't do anything on your own at first.
You may need something to hold onto to just make small movements. It will hurt to cough or laugh.
Support your wound by holding a pillow over your stomach if you need to cough or pass wind.
Drink plenty and eat fibre-rich foods to help prevent constipation. Ask the clinic for something to soothe the pain of trapped wind, which often follows surgery. Peppermint tea can help. Try to wear loose cotton underwear so nothing rubs on your scar.
You may just be glad the birth is over and grateful that you and your baby are well. You may feel really happy, if everything went to plan. Or you may be upset and perhaps sad that you didn't give birth to your baby naturally. After your baby is born, talk about what happened. This will help you to feel better about it.

<title>What happens after the operation?</title>
<body>You'll be given more pain relief after surgery. Getting good pain relief will help you move around, and feed and cuddle your baby.
Your wound dressing will be taken off the next day. Look out for signs of infection, such as extra soreness, redness or discharge. Tell the clinic if you spot these signs.
Wash and dry your wound every day. It's fine to wash and use soap on the wound, as long as you rinse it off. Don't rub the wound. Gently pat it dry with a clean towel.
You'll need to use sanitary pads after your caesarean. The bleeding from your womb is the same as after a natural birth. 
Try to get up as soon as you can. It is best to do this within 24 hours. The sooner you get going, the better it is for your recovery.

<title>What will the scar look like?</title>
<body>In most cases, the cut is made along your pant line. At first, your scar will look very red. But as the weeks and months go by it will slowly fade and your pubic hair will cover it. 
You may notice some numbness on or around your scar. This usually gets better a few months after the operation but it can go on for longer.
If your scar becomes very sore, red or swollen, you may have an infection. Go to the clinic if this happens. You can get the right treatment there.
While your scar heals it may be sensitive and itchy, particularly when the hair re-grows.
A year or two after your operation, the scar will probably have faded to a faint line. It will always be a slightly different colour to your normal skin tone. But it may eventually be almost invisible. Some women get back a flat tummy after a caesarean birth. But, it's quite common to have a bit of tummy overhang left.

<title>How will I feel after I get home?</title>
<body>When you're home, try not to lift anything heavy.  This includes your toddler, if you have one. 
Breastfeeding can be more of a challenge in the early days after a caesarean. Make sure you get plenty of support. Try different positions until you are comfortable. It may help to have someone else around when you're feeding your baby. They can help you to get comfortable before you start, and then hand your baby to you.
Stretching upwards, bending and lifting will be difficult for some time. You won't be able to do heavy jobs around the house. Explain this to your family and ask for their help.
You should not do heavy work until eight to ten weeks after your caesarean. Stick to gentle walking, and gradually build up your strength.

<title>I feel like crying all the time - what's wrong with me?</title>
<body>Pregnancy can be a positive time. But it is not always, and not for every woman. Some women suffer from depression. 
There's no simple set of signs that add up to depression. It varies from person to person. Some people have a low mood all the time. Others feel irritable and tearful, or feel useless and want to withdraw from life. 
You might have trouble concentrating, have problems with sleeping, or feel constantly tired. You may want to eat all the time, or not at all. You might feel that nothing is enjoyable or fun anymore.
Pregnancy can be stressful, especially if you're already caring for young children or are worried about how you are going to manage when the baby comes. It can leave you open to depression.
You may think your sadness is just moodiness. But depression is more than feeling sad or miserable. If you feel really unhappy and it lasts more than a few days you may need help.  You are not the only one to have these feelings. 
Although you may not want to, it may be helpful to talk about how you feel with others, including the clinic.

<title>How will I know if I have gestational diabetes?</title>
<body>It can be hard to spot gestational diabetes without a test. Some mothers have no symptoms. But, there are some signs you can look out for:
You may feel very tired.
You may be really thirsty and need to urinate a lot.
Your eyesight may be blurred.
You are more likely to get it if someone in your family has diabetes. You may also be more likely to get it if you are overweight, or if you had it in a previous pregnancy.
If you think that you may have gestational diabetes, or think that you may be likely to get it, tell the clinic. They will be able to do a test to check.

<title>How will gestational diabetes affect my pregnancy?</title>
<body>This depends on how well you are able to control your diabetes. 
If you have too much sugar in your blood, this can be passed to your baby. Babies born to diabetic mothers can grow very big. You may have to have a caesarean section.
Your baby could also be born with low blood sugar or with jaundice. She may need extra care when she is born. 
You can help prevent these problems by keeping a close eye on your blood sugar. By controlling it, you will help keep your baby healthy. 
You can control your blood sugar by eating a healthy diet and getting some exercise. It is also best to cut down on sugary foods and drinks. They can raise your blood sugar level 
The clinic will show you how to check your blood sugar. They will also do tests at your check-ups to make sure all is well.
Some mothers need medication. You may be given tablets to take each day. Very occasionally you may have to have daily injections. The clinic will show you how to inject yourself with insulin. This sounds scary, but it is easy to do, and it is sometimes the best way to keep you and your baby healthy.

<title>I am so tired - is this normal?</title>
<body>You're not the only one! Many mothers feel the same. Being pregnant puts a strain on your entire body. This can make you very tired. Even if you like to stay up late, you might struggle to stay awake past the early evening now.
In the early stages of pregnancy you feel constantly tired. This is because your body is very busy during these months. This is when you're making the placenta, your baby's life-support system. This process won't be complete until the end of the first three months.
Your hormone levels and need for energy are also rapidly changing. Your blood sugar and blood pressure tend to be lower too. This all adds to your sense of tiredness.
Having low iron levels can also make you feel tired. Make sure you take your daily iron tablet. This will stop you getting anaemic. If your iron levels are very low, you will feel even more tired and lacking in energy.

<title>How long will I feel tired</title>
<body>Fatigue affects everyone differently. Most pregnant women usually feel tiredness in the first three and last three months. 
In the first three months, tiredness is very common. You may also have nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.
If your symptoms are disturbing your sleep, it's not surprising that you'll feel more tired and irritable.
Usually these symptoms pass without any need for treatment.
For most women, the feelings of morning sickness ease after the first three months of pregnancy. 
With luck, you'll feel a burst of energy in the middle of pregnancy. This will take you into your last three months. You may begin to feel tired again sometime around the seventh month. This is because your baby will be getting heavier now.

<title>What can I do to ease the tingling in my hands?</title>
<body>You may find that numbness and tingling in your hands is worse at night. It might wake you up - shifting your sleeping position may make you more comfortable. Try shaking your hands until the tingling reduces.
Try not to sleep leaning on your hands. Don't keep your arm or hand in the same position for long periods of time.
During the day try flexing you wrists and fingers regularly. Try not to do tasks that need repetitive hand movements as this may make your symptoms worse. When you sit down for a rest, put your arms up at shoulder level, on the back of a chair or sofa. This can reduce the swelling and make your hands feel better. 
If your symptoms don't get better, tell the clinic. They may suggest wearing a bandage to keep your wrists in a straight position. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms usually disappear within a year of your baby being born.
If you start to experience swelling on your face and feet as well as your hands, go to the clinic straight away. This could be pre-eclampsia.

<title>What can I do to relieve the pain of headaches?</title>
<body>Dip a cloth in warm water and squeeze it out. Put the cloth around your eyes and nose. You may prefer a cool cloth at the base of your neck for tension headaches.
You could also ask someone to massage your neck and shoulders.
Try to rest and stay relaxed. At work, find somewhere to relax during your break. Try to cut down on chores at home. Explain to your family why you need help.
A regular sleep pattern may help. Lack of sleep or disrupted sleep can trigger headaches. 
If you think your headaches are caused by a certain food, try cutting it out for a couple of weeks to see if it helps. Then start eating the food again, and see if the headaches return. 
Eat little and often, and don't skip meals.
Exercise often, but don't push yourself. Keeping fit may reduce headaches. 
If you'd like to take a painkiller, paramed or panado is safe during pregnancy. Follow the instructions on the packet and buy it from the clinic. This way you will know it's safe.

<title>What can I do to ease heartburn?</title>
<body> It is best not to eat rich, fatty or spicy dishes, chocolate, citrus fruits, alcohol and coffee. A milky drink may help.  
Eat small meals regularly. This leaves less time for acid to build up.
Keep upright at mealtimes. Don't lie down for at least an hour after eating. Even when you're not eating, you should try not to bend over or slump. 
If your heartburn is worse at night, try not to eat for three hours before bed. Drink only water. Sleeping in a propped-up position may also help.
If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking makes heartburn more likely. It is also harmful to your baby.
If your heartburn is particularly bad, ask at the clinic. They may be able to give you an antacid to soothe it. Take it with your meals or when it is very painful. Try not to take it with your iron pill as it may stop you from absorbing the iron.

<title>My breasts look and feel different - am I pregnant?</title>
<body>An early sign of pregnancy is prickling, tingling nipples. The tingling feeling is caused by pregnancy hormones. They increase the amount of blood to your breasts, particularly to your nipples. Once your body gets used to the extra hormones, the tingling will stop. 
Your breasts may become very tender. It will feel like the soreness you have before a period, but they will feel even more sore than usual.
You may also notice that your breasts are larger, with blue veins visible just below the skin. 
The colour of the skin around your nipples may be getting darker. The bumps around your nipples can become more obvious, and your nipples may stick out more. 
If you think you have these signs of pregnancy, go to the clinic.

<title>I have noticed some spots of blood in my underwear - am I pregnant?</title>
<body>A small amount of bleeding or spotting is common in the early stages of pregnancy
Some pregnant women notice spotting in the first part of their pregnancy. This spotting usually makes a pink or brown-coloured stain in your underwear. You may notice it when passing water. You may also feel some cramps.  
This small amount of bleeding is probably caused by the egg planting itself in your womb. 
You may also notice a small amount of blood when your period is due. This is because your body will not have fully adjusted to your pregnancy yet. The hormones which cause your period may break through a bit, causing you to have spotting. 
If you notice these signs and think you may be pregnant go for a check-up now. Staff at the clinic will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. If you are, you can get the care you and your baby need.

<title>I feel sick and nauseous - am I pregnant?</title>
<body>Many women feel sick during pregnancy. It is often the first clear sign that a woman is expecting a baby. Many women start feeling sick in the first month of pregnancy.  You may feel nauseated and queasy, or even vomit. This sickness can affect you at any time of the day or night. 
Pregnancy can affect your appetite in other ways. You may go off some foods, but develop a craving for others. Some women say that they have a metallic taste in their mouth. Others say that they can't stand the taste of coffee, tea or a food they usually like. 
If you are feeling sick and queasy, or you find your tastes in food have started to change, it could be a sign that you are pregnant. Go to the clinic to get a check-up. You will be able to find out for sure and get help and advice on what to do.

<title>I need to urinate more often than usual - am I pregnant?</title>
<body>After about a month of pregnancy, many mothers find that they are urinating more often than usual.This is caused by your body changing for your baby. Your growing baby is still tiny, but the womb is just above your bladder. This means that your baby is sitting on top of your bladder and squashing it. Later, when your bump gets bigger and shows, your baby will have moved up and off the bladder. Then the need to urinate so often will get better. 
You also urinate more because your body is making more hormones.  It's making more blood and your kidneys will be working extra hard too.  
Urinating more during pregnancy is normal. But, if it starts to hurt when you urinate, or if it burns, it could be a sign of infection. 
Go to the clinic to find out if you are pregnant. By finding out now you can start making plans and taking good care of yourself.

<title>I have a bloodstained thick discharge - is this labour?</title>
<body>In the days before labour starts the neck of your womb (your cervix) starts to open up, ready for birth. A mucus plug has sealed your cervix shut during your pregnancy. This helps protect the baby and you from infections. 
Once labour starts the cervix begins to open. But before it does it has to soften .This can happen over a few days before labour starts. As it softens, pieces of the mucus plug tend to break off.  This is called a 'show'. It usually looks rather like a clear jelly, and it can be streaked with blood. Sometimes there will be quite a bit of blood, a bit like a light period. 
If you see the show you can just wait and see . You may not start labour for a few days yet. If you have bleeding you need to get it checked out at the clinic. 
Once you see the show get ready for labour to begin. Pack your bag, make sure you know how to get to the clinic and ask a family member, friend or neighbor to be on standby help if necessary. Usually a show is followed by contractions that steadily get longer and stronger. Then you know you are in labour.

<title>I think my waters have gone - how can I be sure?</title>
<body>Your waters usually break late in the first stage of labour. Sometimes the waters break at the end of pregnancy but before labour starts. 
If your waters go with a gush you will be reasonably sure what it is. It can be a shock as there is usually quite a lot of warm liquid!
But if they go with a trickle it can be hard to decide if it is the waters breaking or just a little urine leaking. 
If you are not sure, put on a sanitary pad and check it after an hour. 
See how wet the pad is. If it is soaking wet it is likely to be the waters rather than leaking urine. 
Check the colour. Waters are almost clear. They may be slightly bloodstained at first or they may have black streaks in them.  Urine is usually much more yellow. 
Smell the pad. Waters have hardly any smell. Some people think they are slightly sweet or smell of almonds. Urine on the other hand has a distinctive smell. 
If you are still not sure, go to the clinic. Even if you are not in labour yet, ''once your waters have broken you have less protection against infection. You need to be checked, and you might need medicine.

<title>I am having regular contractions - is this labour?</title>
<body>Yes, it could be! During early labour, your womb may be contracting very gently. You may feel a dull ache or backache.
As labour gets under way, contractions get more painful. They'll come regularly. These are different to the practice contractions you may well been feeling in pregnancy, which are irregular and painless.
At the beginning, your contractions are quite far apart - maybe 15 or 20 minutes. They are short, only 30 or 40 seconds long. You'll be able walk around and talk. 
As labour progresses, your contractions happen more often, usually every three minutes. They also last longer too, normally about 60 to 90 seconds. 
A contraction usually starts slowly, and gets very intense before fading away. You probably won't be able to talk through them. 'You may have to stop and breathe through them. 
Between contractions, you'll be able to talk, move around, and prepare yourself for the next one.
These strong contractions open your cervix more rapidly. But it may still be many hours before it is fully open.

<title>I'm in labour - when should I go to the clinic?</title>
<body>Head for the clinic as soon as you are pretty sure that you are in labour. If your contractions are regular and getting longer and stronger you are in labour. If your contractions come and go and are short and weak you can wait until they get more regular . 
It's better to go early, especially if you have a long way to go. You may find it hard to travel in strong labour, so if you have a long journey make sure, you set off in the early stages. 
Pack your bag and set out. Ask a family member, friend or neihbour to go with you if you can.
Take into account the time of day. It's better to get to the clinic in daylight, than have to travel in the dark. So even if you think you are only in early labour go to the clinic if it is in the afternoon.
   If your waters break that is a sign that things are speeding up, so get to the clinic quickly.  Use the fastest way to get to the clinic. The sooner you are there, the sooner you can start preparing to meet your baby.

<title>What causes a miscarriage?</title>
<body>You can miscarry without knowing, especially early in pregnancy. Miscarriages before three months are very common.
Miscarriage in early pregnancy usually happens because the baby is not developing well. This can happen for no reason. It is not anybody's fault. Having sex or getting stressed doesn't cause miscarriage.
Later miscarriages are not as common and can be harder to bear. If you are worried about a late miscarriage, you may be able to reduce the risk by eating well and getting treatment for infections at the clinic. This may help to reduce your risk, but might not always be successful.
If you have several miscarriages in a row, you may be desperate to know why this is happening to you. Sadly, in many cases, a cause simply cannot be found. But, many women who have had several miscarriages in a row go on to have a healthy baby in the end.

<title>How will I know if I am having a miscarriage?</title>
<body>You can miscarry without knowing, especially early in pregnancy. Many women mistake a miscarriage for a late period. 
The most likely sign of miscarriage is period-like pains and heavy bleeding. You may notice lumps of blood called blood clots. You may also get painful stomach cramps.
Other signs are less obvious. You may notice you're feeling less sick or your breasts are feeling less tender. But, this is normal if you are three months pregnant. If you are worried - get checked at the clinic to make sure.
A miscarriage later in pregnancy can be a difficult experience. You may have heavy bleeding. Your waters may also break. Some mothers also have very strong, labour-like pains. Others have no pain. 
If you spot any of these signs, or are at all worried, head to the clinic. It will give you peace of mind.

<title>How is labour induced?</title>
<body>If you need to have an induction, you'll be given a date to go into hospital. 
Your blood pressure will be measured and your urine tested.  The position and size of your babywill be assessed.
Your doctor will insert a tablet, pessary or gel into your vagina. It contains a drug. This will make you ready for labour. 
If you are induced with a tablet or gel, you may need a second dose if labour doesn't start. Or the doctor may put a drip up to get contractions going.
If induction fails, you will need to have a caesarean birth.

<title>I'm overdue, now what?</title>
<body>Most babies arrive within a week or two either side of their due date. Twins and triplets may arrive sooner.
If you're only a few days past your due date, most doctors won't offer to induce your labour for a while.
Doctors do worry about babies that are born several weeks past their due date. That's because a very small number of babies die unexpectedly while they are inside the womb if they are more than two weeks overdue.
Doctors aren't sure why the risk increases as the weeks go by. They don't know if it's due to the length of pregnancy or the health of the mum or baby. It may be that if your baby is late, your placenta may not work very well anymore. This means the supply of oxygen and nutrients to your baby may be reduced.
If you go two weeks past your due date and your baby has not come, go to the clinic for help.
You will be sent to a hospital. Here, your labour will be started, or induced.

Luckily, there are lots of things you can do to prepare yourself for labour. There are also some easy things to do to help you deal with contractions and stay strong.

<title>Should I eat if I think I am in labour?</title>
<body>Most women feel hungry during labour, mostly in the early stages. Eating and drinking 'won't harm you or your baby. 
It's best to be guided by what you feel like eating, within reason. High-fat foods can be heavy on your stomach and make you feel sick. Sugary foods are easy to eat and boost energy levels. But this energy won't last long.
Starchy foods are best to eat during labour as they're easily digested and give a slow release of energy. This will help you through contractions. 
A few good options are bread, corn, potatoes, bananas or yoghurt.
Eat little and often, rather than having one big meal. Try a small snack every hour while you're in early labour. This will store up plenty of energy for the work ahead. Try to eat something before you go to the clinic. Eating small snacks may help you cope better. 
If you're not feeling hungry try a smoothie, a banana, or anything you want!

<title>I am in labour and have  backache - what can I do?</title>
<body>If you have backache in between as well as during contractions, your baby might be lying back to back with you. You need to get the weight of the baby off your spine.
To do this, go on your hands and knees. Now, your baby can drop away from your spine. This reduces the pain. It may also help your baby into a better position for the birth.
If the blood is rushing to your head, try resting your head, shoulders and forearms on something so that your head isn't hanging down.
Try to stay upright for as long as possible. Lean forwards during your contractions - use something to lean on.
Ask your birth partner to massage your back and rock your pelvis during contractions to help your baby turn around.
Try not to stay sitting in a chair or leaning back on a bed for too long.
If you get tired, lie on your left side: your pelvis can still expand to give your baby space to turn while you are resting.

<title>I want to push - what's the best position for me?</title>
<body>Listen to the midwife. You may feel like pushing but the midwife might ask you not to if your cervix is not ready. It can be hard not to push when you want to. Lie on your left side. Or bring your knees up to your chest, with your face on the floor and your bottom in the air. Pant through contractions. 
If it's time to push, find a comfortable upright position for pushing your baby out. You might not need help with instruments to deliver your baby if you're upright than if you lie down.
If your midwife prefers you to give birth on the bed, kneel on the mattress and lean against pillows placed at the top end. If you give birth on the floor, try kneeling. When your baby's head is coming, all-fours is an excellent position. The head is able to emerge gently. You're less likely to tear.

<title>My waters have broken with a gush - what do I do?</title>
<body>While your baby is growing inside your womb, he is cushioned and protected by a bag of fluid. When your labour is going to begin, the bag gets torn. The fluid leaks out through your vagina. This is known as your waters breaking. 
Put on a sanitary pad for protection. If there is a lot of fluid, you might need a towel instead. 
You need to go to the clinic straight away once your waters have broken, even if you 'are not having contractions. Once your waters have broken, you have less protection against infection.
Infection is more likely if there is a long gap between your waters breaking and labour starting. Sometimes it can get into your womb. This can be harmful for your baby.
 If the clinic is worried about infection, your baby may be induced. 
If you think that your waters have broken, head to the clinic. It is almost time to meet your baby.

<title>I feel unwell and have tummy cramps</title>
<body>Tummy cramps are usually nothing to worry about in early pregnancy. But if you're having other symptoms, it may mean you need to get help. 
Try resting or taking a warm bath. This might ease your cramps and make you feel better. But, if nothing helps and you still feel unwell, go to the clinic. There might be more to your cramps than pregnancy aches and pains. The clinic will be able to find out what is wrong and can give you the right treatment.
You should also go to the clinic if you have bleeding, fever, pain when you urinate or are being sick.

<title>Sickness and vomiting in pregnancy</title>
<body>Feeling sick is an uncomfortable part of being pregnant, but it is very common. Most women find they feel better after the first three months of pregnancy. Being sick can make you worry about the health of your baby. Your baby is very tiny at this stage and however sick you are your baby will be fine. 
How bad you feel varies from woman to woman. You may just feel a bit sick when you first wake up, or certain smells might make you feel sick all day. You may find you are feeling or being sick for weeks or months. If you are expecting twins, it may be worse.
If you get it badly you might find it hard to carry on with normal life. You may worry that you should be feeling happy about your pregnancy and not sad and ill. You may feel that nobody understands. Talk to your family and friends about how you feel.
Pregnancy sickness is normal, but if you're vomiting many times a day, unable to eat and drink without being sick and losing weight, you may need treatment at the clinic.

<title>The skin on my face is patchy</title>
<body>You might see brown patches on your forehead, cheeks, and neck. On darker-skinned women, they appear as lighter patches. These changes are caused by a hormone. It protects the skin against light.These patches often show up around the upper lip, nose, cheekbones and forehead. You may also get patches on your cheeks or along your jaw line.
Contact with sunlight will darken the patches. This will make them more obvious.
The patches will begin to fade within three months of your baby's birth. Your skin should go back to its normal shade. In some women, though, the changes never go completely.
You can help protect your skin by covering up and wearing a hat when you go outside.

<title>Will being sick harm my baby?</title>
<body>Feeling and being sick won't harm your baby, but you do need to make sure you get plenty of fluids.Eat whatever you can cope with. You can eat more when you feel better. You will probably feel better by three months of pregnancy.
Don't feel bad if you can't eat healthy food. You might only be able to manage simple foods and water. There will be time for you to eat healthily once your sickness has passed.
To help you get enough goodness, take iron and folic acid pills daily throughout your pregnancy. This will help your baby develop. It will also help you to stay healthy and can prevent heavy bleeding at the birth. Start taking the pills now to help your baby grow well. You can get them at the clinic.
Sickness is a normal part of pregnancy, but go to the clinic straight away if you're being sick often, can't eat and drink or if you are losing weight.

<title>How can I avoid piles?</title>
<body>Piles are common in pregnancy, but you can avoid getting them.
The best way to avoid piles is to make sure that you don't become constipated. 
Eat a high-fibre diet, including wholemeal bread, plenty of grains and brown rice. Fruit and vegetables will also help. 
Drink between six and eight glasses of water a day, so you don't become dehydrated. 
Try to exercise, even if you only go for a short walk. You could also try doing pelvic floor exercises every day. This may help to stop piles from developing.
These exercises increase blood flow around your bottom. They strengthen your muscles. Strong muscles will help you give birth and speed up your recovery afterwards.
You can also try going to the toilet as soon as you need to. Waiting can make your stools harder and drier.
Try putting your feet up on a stool or a stack of books or newspapers when passing a stool: it might make opening your bowels easier.
If you still have constipation, ask your clinic for a laxative that is safe to take during pregnancy.

<title>How can I cope with piles?</title>
<body>Take warm baths to ease the itching and pain. Resist scratching your bottom, as it can make it worse.
Use a cold compress, such as an ice pack, to relieve the pain around your bottom.
Gently and thoroughly clean your bottom after you've passed a stool. Wiping it with a wet cloth can be more comfortable than using toilet paper. Patting rather than rubbing dry is best.
Try pushing the piles gently back into your anus with a clean finger when you are having a bath or in the shower.
Your clinic may give you gentle ointments to soothe your bottom.
There are many products on the market to relieve piles, but check at the clinic first that they are safe for you to use.
In most cases, piles will simply shrink or disappear as your body recovers after your baby's birth.

<title>Mineral-rich foods</title>
<body>A varied diet is the best way to get the minerals and other nutrients you and your baby need. 
If you eat foods from these four main food groups you will get the minerals you need.
Fruit and vegetables. These can be fresh, frozen, tinned or dried. Try to have five portions a day. Eating lots of different coloured vegetables will give you lots of goodness.
Starchy, filling foods  such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes. Base your meals around starchy foods. This will give you plenty of energy.
Protein-rich foods, such as meat, fish, eggs and pulses. These foods are also good sources of iron. They will help you to stay strong.
Dairy foods, such as milk, cheese and yoghurt, which contain calcium. Dairy products, along with sea fish and sea salt are all good sources of iodine. You need plenty of iodine in your diet to help your baby's brain development. Try to have some every day.
By eating a range of these foods you will be able to stay fit and strong, as well as grow a healthy baby.

<title>I am suddenly very thirsty</title>
<body>If you are suddenly thirsty it could be a sign that you are not drinking enough. Your body is telling you that it is too dry. 
You need to drink at least eight glasses of fluid every day. If the weather is very hot and you are sweating, you will need even more. It doesn't matter what you drink, as long as you drink whenever you feel thirsty.
Check the colour of your urine to see if you are drinking enough. It should be a pale straw colour. If it is darker, you need to drink more. If you are not drinking enough you may also feel tired and sick, get a headache, become constipated or get a dry nose or mouth. 
Carry a bottle of water with you and sip regularly. This will stop your body getting dry. 
Sometimes being thirsty is a sign of a problem. Go to the clinic if it is painful to pass urine, your vision is affected or you feel very tired.  Staff will be able to give you the treatment you need.

<title>Skin changes during pregnancy</title>
<body>When you are pregnant, your body goes through many changes. These changes can affect your skin. You may begin to notice stretch marks appear as your bump grows, or the colour of your skin may change on some parts of your body.
Your skin can get more sensitive during pregnancy. This is partly because of higher hormone levels. But your skin has also become more stretched and delicate.
Soaps and detergents may suddenly cause itching and soreness. If you have eczema, it may get worse.
Your skin may become more prickly than usual in the sunlight.
Wear loose, cotton clothes to keep your body cool.
Now is a good time to keep your body moisturised. Try a cream like cocoa butter or add bath oil to your bath water, to help keep your skin supple.

<title>What can I do to reduce the swelling of my feet?</title>
<body>Put your feet up whenever possible, to help your blood flow. At work take a rest when you can. Even five minutes sitting with your feet up will help with the swelling. 
 At home, try to lie down on your left side. This takes pressure off your veins.
Drink plenty of water. Surprisingly, this helps your body not to hold on to water.
Regular exercise helps, too.
If you're travelling long distances sitting down, try to stretch your legs regularly and rotate your ankles.
Salty foods can make you retain water and they can increase your blood pressure so try to cut down on these foods. 
Ask someone to massage your ankles and feet, upward towards your knees. This helps to move the fluid away from your feet.
The swelling won't last forever. Just like so many other pregnancy problems, it should go soon after you have your baby.

<title>How can I control my weight gain?</title>
<body>The best thing you can do is keep eating sensibly. You don't need any more than usual until the last three months of your pregnancy. Even then you will only need a little extra.
It's best not to diet while you are pregnant. Try eating a wide variety of healthy foods instead.
To eat well, have a range of foods. Starchy foods like bread, pasta, potatoes, rice and mealies should make up a third of what you eat daily.
Fruit and vegetables should make up another third.
You need proteins, such as meat, fish, eggs and pulses, too. Dairy foods, such as milk, yoghurt and cheese are full of goodness for you and your baby. Low-fat versions are a good option if you want to keep your weight down.
You don't need to have food or drink that is high in fat or sugar, such as biscuits, cakes or fizzy drinks. But it won't do you any harm to have them in small amounts.

<title>Can sex cause bleeding?</title>
<body>The opening to your womb (called the cervix) can sometimes become sore. Pregnancy hormones can change the surface of the cervix, making it more likely to bleed. You may sometimes notice a bit of blood after sex. This is nothing to worry about as long as you are not in pain and you don't get bleeding at any other time.
Sex will not harm your baby. She is protected inside the strong muscles of your womb. There is a plug of mucus at the opening of the womb as well, which stops anything getting in.
You might notice that your baby moves around a bit more afterwards, but she is just reacting to your movements. It is nothing to worry about, and it won't usually make you bleed.
But, if you find that you are bleeding all the time or a lot, it is important to go to the clinic straight away. The staff there will be able to help you.

<title>What should I do if I spot bleeding?</title>
<body>If you are bleeding, you should go to the clinic now, even if the bleeding stops.
Staff at the clinic may gently examine inside you to see that all is well. You might need to have an ultrasound scan. A scan can check that your baby's safe inside your womb. An examination and scan are safe for you to have. 
The clinic may want to do a few tests. Your blood or urine may be tested to see what your pregnancy hormone levels are like.
Your baby is likely to be fine. This is because spotting or light bleeding is generally harmless and usually stops on its own. Many pregnancies carry on despite early bleeding.

<title>What can I do to ease this pulling pain under my bump?</title>
<body>Sit down and relax. Resting comfortably should help.
If sitting doesn't help, try resting on your hands and knees. Or leaning forwards over the back of a sofa.
Try moving slowly and smoothly from a sitting or lying position. This gives your muscles time to adapt and support you before you change position.
You could also try tilting your hips backwards by slumping your back before you stand up.
Sometimes wearing a long scarf or a large elasticated tubular bandage tied under your bump can help.  This can help to take some of the weight of your baby off your tummy muscles. Your clinic will be able to advise you.

<title>Is it safe to eat eggs now I'm pregnant?</title>
<body> 
Eggs are a great food to eat if you cook them well. But raw or soft-cooked eggs contain germs that make you ill. When you are pregnant, you can get sick easier.
Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are solid. This is the best way to kill all the germs.
To get firm eggs, boil your eggs for at least seven minutes. If you are frying them, fry on both sides. You should also poach eggs until the white is completely set and the yolk firm. If any part of your egg is runny, cook it some more.
Try not to eat anything with raw or runny eggs in. Mousses, ice cream, meringues and fresh mayonnaise all have uncooked eggs. 
Sickness won't harm your baby. But it can hit you harder when you're pregnant. It can give you severe sickness and diarrhoea, tummy pain, a headache and a fever.
If you feel ill, drink lots of clean water. Try a little cooked food. If you don't feel better, go to the clinic. The staff will be able to help you.

<title>Tummy cramps and early labour</title>
<body>If you body starts getting ready for birth before nine months of pregnancy, this is called premature labour. You may feel pain in your lower tummy area, have backache or mild tummy cramps. You may feel regular contractions. Your waters may also break.
If you are less than nine months pregnant and feel like this, go to the clinic straightaway. Take someone with you to support you. You may be going into labour early. The staff at the clinic will be able to help you.
If you have these signs and are nine months pregnant, you may be in the early stages of labour. At this stage, the cramps are not a worry. They are a normal part of your body getting ready to give birth. You may also feel constant lower backache.

Go to the toilet soon after having sex.
Try to have baths instead of showers.
Wear cotton knickers and loose clothes.

<title>What can I do to ease constipation?</title>
<body>Pay attention to when and how you go to the toilet. Always go to the toilet when you first feel the urge. First thing in the morning or about half an hour after a meal are good times to try. Have plenty of time and privacy.
Eat a healthy diet. Include high-fibre foods such as wholegrain cereals, wholemeal bread, fresh fruit and vegetables. If you're not used to eating high-fibre foods, slowly introduce these into your diet to prevent wind and bloating.
Drink plenty of fluids. Try drinking at least eight glasses of fluid every day. This is at least 1.5 litres. Fruit juice, especially apricot and prune juice, are good choices. 
Exercise! Walking, swimming and other gentle exercise may help. Keeping active will make you feel fitter and healthier.
If your constipation lasts for more than a few days, go to the clinic. They may be able to give you some treatment to ease the problem.

<title>How long will I feel so tired</title>
<body>Fatigue affects everyone differently. Most pregnant women usually feel tiredness in the first three and last three months. 
In the first three months, tiredness is very common. You may also have nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.
If your symptoms are disturbing your sleep, it's not surprising that you'll feel more tired and irritable.
Usually these symptoms pass without any need for treatment.
For most women, the feelings of morning sickness ease after the first three months of pregnancy. 
With luck, you'll feel a burst of energy in the middle of pregnancy. This will take you into your last three months. You may begin to feel tired again sometime around the seventh month. This is because your baby will be getting heavier now.

<title>I have an itchy rash on my tummy</title>
<body>This could be caused by a condition called polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, or PEP. It sounds scary. But it's a common and harmless cause of itching with a rash. You're most likely to develop it in your last three months. 
PEP is related to the stretching of your skin during pregnancy. It is likely to affect you if it's your first pregnancy. If you are expecting twins or more, PEP is even more common.
Also, if you've put on a lot of weight during your pregnancy you may be more likely to get PEP.
PEP often starts with an itchy rash on your tummy, then your thighs. You may notice it more on your stretch marks.
The rash may have small raised red lumps. You might see large red areas of skin. As your baby's birth approaches you'll probably notice it fading away. It go after you have had your baby. 
There are various treatments for PEP, depending on your symptoms. Tell the clinic about your rash at your check-up. They will be able to tell you the best way to cope with it.

<body>Pre-eclampsia can happen when the placenta isn't working fully. It can make you and your baby quite ill if you aren't treated. Pre-eclampsia occurs in the second half of your pregnancy. You're most likely to develop it in the last three months.
If you have pre-eclampsia, the flow of blood through the placenta can be limited. This will affect your baby because not enough oxygen or nutrients will get through to her. Missing out on these can restrict your baby's growth.
Pre-eclampsia can range from mild to severe. Mild pre-eclampsia is quite common. You may not know that you have it. 
Early check-ups and treatment will help to keep you and your baby well. Going to the clinic early in your pregnancy is important.
When you go to the clinic, you will have tests for pre-eclampsia. Your blood pressure and your urine will be tested. These checks will help to keep you and your baby safe and well.

<title>Why do I have indigestion?</title>
<body>You produce high levels of hormones early in pregnancy. These relax the muscles in your body, including your digestive system. This means that digesting your food happens more slowly, which can cause indigestion. Indigestion can leave you with bloating and heartburn. You might feel ill, vomit or just bring up bits of food.
Indigestion is unpleasant for you, but is not harmful for your baby. In fact, the slowing of your digestive system may benefit your baby. It gives your body more time to pass foods through to him.
Stop eating foods that make your indigestion worse. These foods will probably be rich, spicy foods, chocolate, fruit juices and fatty foods. Caffeine or alcohol can also make your indigestion worse. You'll need to limit these during pregnancy anyway.
It is also best to avoid smoking. It can relax the gap between your stomach and your food pipe. This means you're more likely to have indigestion and heartburn.

<title>How can I ease my indigestion?</title>
<body>Luckily, there are many things that will help you feel better.
Try not to put extra pressure on your tummy after a meal. Sit up straight, wear loose, comfortable clothing, and wait at least an hour after a meal before lying down. Try to bend at your knees instead of from your waist.
If you have indigestion at night, eat your dinner at least three hours before you go to bed. Also try sleeping with your upper body propped up with pillows.
Eat several small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals. 
Stop eating foods that make your indigestion worse. These foods will probably be rich, spicy foods, chocolate, fruit juices and fatty foods. Caffeine or alcohol can also make indigestion worse. 
Smoking can also make it worse. Try not to do it. Smoking is also harmful to your baby.

<title>How do I know if I'm likely to get pre-eclampsia?</title>
<body>No one fully knows why pre-eclampsia happens. We do know you are more likely to get it if you are pregnant for the first time. This is one reason why it's important to go to the clinic as soon as you think you are pregnant.
If your sister or your mother had pre-eclampsia, you are more likely to get it as well.
If you have had a ten-year or longer gap between pregnancies, this can be a risk.
If you had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, you are much more likely to get it again.
If you are 40 or older when you get pregnant, or you are overweight, you may be more at risk.
If you are expecting twins or more, you may also be more likely to get pre-eclampsia. 
You might have a medical problem, such as kidney disease or high blood pressure. This is another risk.
If you are at risk, you may need more checkups. This is best way of keeping you and your baby safe. The tests at the clinic will pick up any early signs.

<title>What should I do if I think I have pre-eclampsia?</title>
<body>If it's mild you may not know that you have it. If you go to the clinic, the signs will be picked up in one of your checkups. Go early in your pregnancy. This will help you and your baby to stay well.
Pre-eclampsia can go from mild to severe. It starts to affect other parts of your body as it gets worse. This means you may get more serious symptoms. If the clinic doesn't know you have pre-eclampsia, you won't get the right care. 
Go to the clinic straight away if you think you have symptoms. It can be treated and managed.
If you have mild pre-eclampsia, you'll have frequent checks on your blood pressure and your urine. You may have blood tests and scans. You may be given medicine to lower your blood pressure.
You may have to go into hospital if you have severe pre-eclampsia. If the clinic is worried about your baby's wellbeing, he may have to be born early.

<title>Why do I have so much wind now I am pregnant?</title>
<body>Everyone, pregnant or not, has some wind. You may pass wind about 15 times a day. Anything up to 40 times a day is normal.
Wind gets caught in your body when you swallow air. It is part of the normal process of breaking down your food as it passes through your digestive tract.
You may have more wind during pregnancy. Don't be surprised if you burp frequently. You may feel bloated many weeks before your bump starts to show.
The hormones that your body makes in pregnancy relax your muscles throughout your body. This includes the muscle that helps you to digest your food. This means that you may feel more wind. You might feel bloated. You might feel discomfort in your tummy, especially after a big meal.
In later pregnancy, your growing baby crowds the space in your belly. This slows down your digestion and can make you feel even more bloated.

<title>What foods cause wind?</title>
<body>Some people get wind from certain foods. The same foods might not bother other people.
The foods most likely to cause wind are those containing starch that your body can't absorb. Your body can't break down these types of starches properly. These foods include beans and leafy green vegetables.
You may also have more wind after eating food and drink containing a type of sugar. This sugar is found in fruits.
You may get more wind and bloating because you are lactose intolerant. This means that your body cannot digest dairy products. This includes milk, ice cream and yoghurt. 
If you do have wind or bloating shortly after eating a particular food, you may want to reduce how much you eat of it. But, if certain vegetables and fruits give you wind or bloating, don't totally cut them out. Vegetables and fruit are an important part of a healthy diet.

<title>What can I do to avoid wind?</title>
<body>Try varying your diet. You may find that one portion of fruit and four of vegetables works best for you. Try different combinations until you find one that works.
Try avoiding very fatty or fried foods. They don't cause wind, but can cause bloating because they slow digestion.
Eat several small meals throughout the day.
Eat slowly, and chew well. This will help your body to digest food.
Sit up while you're eating or drinking. Your tummy won't be squashed while you digest your food.
Wear loose, comfortable clothing with no tightness around your tummy.
Try exercising. Even a brisk walk can help.
Don't smoke or chew gum. Both make you produce more saliva, which means more swallowing. It's best to stop smoking during pregnancy anyway, as it's harmful to your baby.
If you have severe pain or cramps, you might need to go to the clinic. It could just be severe indigestion. It may be an infection. But it could be pre-eclampsia. This is a serious form of pregnancy high blood pressure. Go straight to the clinic if you feel like this.
