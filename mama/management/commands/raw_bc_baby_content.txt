<title>How might I feel after the birth?</title>
<body>Having a baby is a  life changing event. You probably feel happy and excited about your new baby most of the time and enjoy being a new mother. But you may also feel exhausted and sore from the birth. Worries about money, work and the future can also make this time stressful. 
With all these things on your mind, it is normal to  feel a little sad and tearful. But this should soon pass. 
Take things slowly and make sure you have plenty of rest. Try to sleep when your baby sleeps. Eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables will also keep you energised. 
Ask your family to help. They can make sure that you have regular meals, and that you have a cool drink every time you breastfeed. Ask friends and family to help with cooking, shopping and household tasks, too.
Spend time getting to know your baby, and getting used to your new job as a mother. 
If you are having problems feeding your baby, your post-natal bleeding is heavy, or you have a fever, go  to the clinic. Staff there will give you the help you need.

<title>How will my body change after the birth?</title>
<body>After your baby is born, your body will change and adapt. At first, your tummy will be a little flabby and wrinkly, but it will soon return to normal. 
You may feel mild labour-like pains, especially when breastfeeding.  This is a good sign. It shows that your womb is shrinking back to its usual size.
You will also lose blood in the first few days, like a heavy period. The blood flow will then settle down and get lighter.  The area around your vagina may be sore, especially if you have stitches or bruising. Bathe the area with water and a little salt to soothe it. 
Your ankles may be swollen for a week or so, and you may sweat a lot, too.
Your breasts will be soft for the first few days before your milk ‘comes in'. Then they may feel hot, swollen and tender. Wear a bra or use cloths to support them.
Some of your hair may fall out. This won't last long and your hair will return to the way it was before you were pregnant.
If your bottom itches and it hurts to open your bowels, you may have piles.  Wash the area and pat it dry gently.  Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables and drink lots of water to keep your stools soft.

<title>How will my body look in a few months time?</title>
<body>Over the first few months, your body will return to normal. Gentle exercise will help your stretched tummy muscles regain their tone. It's a good idea to keep doing exercises to strengthen your tummy for at least three months after you've given birth.
Now that you are breastfeeding, your breasts will be larger and heavier. But larger breasts may not be as self-supporting as they were before, and smaller breasts may not be as perky. Pregnancy causes these changes, not breastfeeding. 
Many women find that their breasts get smaller after they finish breastfeeding. It can take several months for the breasts to build up the fatty deposits which give them their rounded shape. So if you feel your breasts have all but disappeared, just give it time! 
Your body may have matured into a more womanly shape. Be proud of it. It's done a wonderful job of bringing your baby into the world.

<title>Why might I need stitches after the birth?</title>
<body>When you give birth, the area around the vagina needs to stretch to let your baby's head out. Your body makes hormones which help you to stretch more easily. But some babies need a bit more room. This means that the skin and muscles around your vagina may tear.
This may sound scary, but tears are common during labour.. Staff at the clinic will check you after you've given birth to see if you've torn, and if so, how far.
Some mums need a small cut to help their baby out. Clinic staff stitch this cut up after the baby has been born. If you need a cut or stitches, staff numb the area so that you feel as little pain as possible.
Afterwards, you may be bruised and sore in the area around your vagina.  This will get better during the first week or so. The bruising and swelling will go down and the stitches will heal. You may need to take some painkillers at first. Rest will help, so try to feed your baby while lying down.

<title>How can I soothe the tender area around my stitches?</title>
<body>Stitches can be sore and uncomfortable. To soothe the tender area, try these tips:
If you have some ice cubes, you can make an ice pack. Wrap some ice in a clean, damp cloth and use it to cool the area. 
Pour a jug of warm water over the area when you pass urine. This will cool it down and help reduce the sting.
If your stitches are very painful, get some rest. Sit on a cushion or pillow, or lie down.
Add a handful of salt to some water when bathing.. This will soothe and clean the stitches. Pat them dry with a clean, soft towel.
Take painkillers. Ask at the clinic what is safe to take while you are breastfeeding. 
Ask for help if your stitches become more painful or you get a smelly discharge – you may have an infection. Go to the clinic if you have to rush to the toilet when you need to pass stools, or if you can't control your bowels when you break wind. Clinic staff will be able to help you.

<title>How can I help my stitches to heal?</title>
<body>You need to keep your stitches clean to keep germs away. Try these tips to help you heal:
Wash the stitches once a day. Add a little salt to the water to soothe the area.
Change your sanitary pad or cloth often. Wash your hands before and after you do so.
Try to expose your stitches to the air. Put an old towel on your bed and take your underwear off. Rest for ten minutes or so, once or twice a day. This will give you some extra time to relax!
Drink plenty of water and eat lots of fruit and vegetables. You'll be more comfortable if you can open your bowels easily.
Most mums find that their tears or cuts heal well. The bruising usually gets better within a few days and your stitches should heal within three to four weeks of your baby's birth. By two months you should be pain-free. 
If you're very sore, go to the clinic. Staff there will be able to help you.

<title>Why should I exercise my pelvic floor, and how do I do it?</title>
<body>Your pelvic floor muscles help to hold your vagina together.  These muscles stretch during pregnancy and labour. They need a little help to get back to how they were before you were pregnant.
Doing pelvic floor exercises can help reduce swelling and speed up healing. They will also help prevent your bowel or bladder leaking.  
To do the exercises, squeeze the muscles around the vagina as tightly as you can. Hold for a few seconds, then let go. These are the muscles you use to hold your urine in. No-one can see you doing this.
You can practise squeezing your muscles for real on the toilet.  Let a little urine go, and then squeeze to hold the rest in. Let a little more go and squeeze again. Finally, empty your bladder completely.  This will help you feel which muscles you need to exercise.  
Do these exercises several times a day. This will give you a strong pelvic floor.

<title>How much will I bleed after the birth?</title>
<body>All women  bleed after giving birth. This will happen whether you gave birth vaginally or if you had a caesarean. Your body is emptying the lining of your womb. The blood may come out in gushes or flow like a heavy period. 
The bleeding will change colour and become less heavy as your womb heals and gets smaller. At first, the flow of blood will be heavy and bright red, and may have small lumps in it. It will change to pink, then brown, and then to yellow or white.
 If it becomes bright red again, it is a sign that you are doing too much. Try to rest more. Perhaps ask a family member to help you with household chores.
Use maternity pads or clean cotton cloths to absorb the blood. Don't use tampons for the first six weeks, because they can cause infection.
You may need to change your pad or cloth every hour or two to start with. As the flow reduces, you can change the pad or cloth less often. Make sure you wash your hands before and after changing it. This will keep germs away.

<title>How long will my bleeding last after the birth?</title>
<body>You may bleed for three weeks, although some mothers bleed for six weeks. Heavy, red bleeding usually stops within the first week. If you are too active and don't get enough rest, it may start flowing again. If you see bright red blood, try to rest. Your body needs to relax after having a baby.
All mothers bleed after birth. It is a normal part of your body's recovery. But, there are some signs to look out for.
If you spot any of these signs, or feel at all unwell, go straight to the clinic. Staff there will be able to find out what is wrong and can give you the help you need.

<title>How soon will my periods start after the birth?</title>
<body>No two mothers are the same. Breastfeeding delays periods for all women, but some mothers have them earlier than others. 
The more breastmilk you make for your baby, the longer it will take for your periods to come back. If your baby is still waking for feeds in the night, you probably won't have periods yet. 
Your periods may return sooner if your baby sleeps for longer than six hours through the night. This is because you are not making so much milk and are feeding less.  
If your baby is six months or older, he has probably started eating solids. This also means that he will be drinking less milk. Your periods may return soon after this.
Until you have a period, you may not know when you are fertile.  You may or may not get pregnant. It's important to use a condom when you have sex again.  This will give you more time to enjoy your baby and will also protect you from infections..

<title>Will I have periods while I am breastfeeding?</title>
<body>For most mothers, periods are delayed while they breastfeed. But some mothers do start their periods again while still making milk for their baby. It depends on how much milk your baby has, and how often he feeds.
After your baby is born, you will bleed for up to six weeks. The bleeding is caused by your body clearing out your womb's lining. This is similar to a period, but it will last much longer. Slowly, the bleeding will get less heavy and will become a dark colour. It will then stop. You may then find that you don't bleed again for a while.
When your baby begins to sleep through the night, or when he starts eating solid food, your periods are more likely to start. This is because you may be making less milk. 
However, for some mothers this doesn't happen. Some mothers can breastfeed for a whole year without having a period.
Every woman is different. Getting your periods while breastfeeding is just as normal as not getting them. Your body will return to its usual routine in time.

<title>Can I get pregnant if I am breastfeeding?</title>
<body>If you feed your baby breastmilk day and night, you are unlikely to get pregnant. But you can't rely on it! As you breastfeed your baby less, it is more likely that you will become fertile again. You are most fertile about two weeks before your period.  
Your body makes hormones, which all do different jobs. Some help your milk to flow;, others help your body to get ready for pregnancy.  
Your hormones start to change while you are breastfeeding. You won't know if you are fertile or not. It's important to use a condom when you start having sex again. This will help you to plan your family and will give you time to enjoy your new baby.
When your periods start, it will be clear that you are fertile again. You could get pregnant. Having another baby too soon could put your health at risk. Talk to staff at the clinic about contraception. There are lots of different options to choose from.

<title>When can we have sex after the birth?</title>
<body>Have sex whenever you are ready. It's different for all women.  Some start having sex again within the first month; others may not have sex again for a year.
If your baby isn't sleeping well, you may feel too tired to have sex. You may still be sore from the birth. Or your partner may be working extra hours to bring in more money for the family. 
Maybe you just don't have the time or the energy. Or maybe you don't feel very good about yourself right now. This is normal - many women take a while to get used to their bodies again.
 You may also feel that your body is only meant for caring for your child, and can only imagine yourself as a mother, not a lover! Many women feel the same.
There is no rush. Talk about your feelings and needs with your partner.

<title>Will it hurt to have sex after the birth?</title>
<body>Many new mothers are afraid of having sex after giving birth. You're not alone. The usual reason is feeling sore.
Even if you didn't need stitches, the area around your vagina can feel bruised and sensitive for a while. Try to let the wound heal before you have sex.  
Keep the area clean by washing it very gently in warm water. Try adding a handful of salt to the water, too. Salt helps to clean and heal.
The area around your vagina may feel very sore or dry. If so, have sex slowly and gently. 
If you are worried about having sex again, it might be better to build up to it. Maybe you could just try kissing and touching each other for a few days, then think about sex.
When you are ready, have slow, gentle sex. Even if you take it gently, sex may still be painful. If sex continues to be painful, talk to staff at the clinic. They will be able to find out what is wrong.

<title>I don't want sex, but my partner does</title>
<body>You and your partner need to talk and share your feelings.  He might feel rejected if you don't want sex.  You need to explain what is troubling you.  If you don't feel attractive, perhaps ask your partner to compliment you more. If you are worried about pain during sex, tell your partner.
If you are not ready, try other things which would be enjoyable for both of you. Maybe just kiss and hold each other. Or you could try touching and stroking each other intimately. 
It is important that you feel comfortable. If you take small steps, and slowly increase your intimacy with your partner, then you will soon feel more confident about sex. 
It is also important to make time for each other. If you are affectionate with each other, then you will feel more positive about having sex in the future.

<body>Try not to rush things. Don't feel pushed into something you are not ready for. 
Build up to sex slowly. If you are still sore, perhaps just kiss, stroke and touch other for a while. This kind of intimacy, without having full sex, can make many couples feel very close to each other.
When you are ready, try having sex with you on top of him. This position helps you to be in control, and it will give you confidence!
If you are experiencing dryness around your vagina, build up to sex very slowly, with plenty of kissing and touching before it. This helps to prepare your body for sex. 
Looking after yourself will help you keep up your energy levels.  Eat lots of fresh foods and drink plenty of water. Soon you'll feel sexy again.
Doing pelvic floor exercises will help the muscles in your vagina back into shape. Having tighter muscles in your vagina will make sex more enjoyable for you and your partner.

<title>Postnatal symptoms you should never ignore</title>
<body>Now that your new baby is here, it is easy to focus all of your attention on her. But your body has been through a lot. If you have problems, act on them early. Your baby needs a healthy mother.
In case of emergencies, plan ahead now. Decide who will look after your other children if you or your baby are ill. Also decide how you will get to the clinic and who you will take with you. Try to find the fastest route and the quickest form of transport. You may need some money for this, so start putting a little bit aside just in case. It will give you peace of mind.
If you spot any of these signs, go to the clinic. Staff there will find out what is wrong and can give you the treatment you need:

<title>I am suddenly bleeding heavily just after the birth - what should I do?</title>
<body>If you are soaking more than one large pad or cloth an hour, go to the clinic now. 
Some bleeding is normal. Your body is clearing out the lining of your womb. But if you suddenly start to lose fresh red blood, you need help. This blood loss may make you feel dizzy, sweaty, or faint. 
There are many reasons why this happens. After birth, the womb usually shuts off the blood vessels that took blood through to the baby. If this doesn't happen, the blood vessels leak into the womb and cause heavy bleeding.
 Sometimes the placenta doesn't come away cleanly, and this, too, can bleed heavily. 
Clinic staff can help stop the flow of blood. You may also need extra fluid through a drip to replace what you have lost. Go to the clinic as soon as you see heavy or bright red blood.
You'll need lots of rest when you get home. Ask your family and friends for help. If you have any medicines to take, finish them even if you feel better. This will help you to recover.

<title>I am breathless and have a pain in my chest just after the birth - what should I do?</title>
<body>It's normal to feel breathless if you've just done something active, such as walking up a hill or chasing after one of your children. After a few minutes' rest, you usually feel fine. But if you get very breathless or wheezy and it does not get better when you rest, you need help. 
Breathlessness and chest pain may be caused by an infection. Or it may be a sign that there is a lump (clot) of blood stuck in part of your lung. 
Staff at the clinic can help you breathe more easily.  They will give you a check-up to find out what is wrong. If you are struggling for breath, have pains in your chest, or you cough up blood, go to the clinic straight away.
 You'll need lots of rest when you get home. Ask friends and family to help you with any work. If the clinic gives you any medicine, take all of it. You will need all the medicine to get better.

<title>I have a fever and feel very unwell after the birth- what should I do?</title>
<body>Usually you can cool down by resting, finding shade and drinking lots of water. Cold cloths can help, too. But if you feel so hot that nothing helps, you may have a fever.  If you do, you need treatment at the clinic.
Fever is often the first sign of infection. You can get ill very quickly if you have an infection that is not treated straight away. Common places for infection are in your stitches or your womb.
At the clinic, staff  can help you cool down. They will try to find out what has caused the infection, and then treat it.  If you have a high fever, go straight to the clinic.
Get plenty of rest when you get home, and drink lots of clean water. Try to eat fruit and vegetables with each meal, too. They will boost your strength.

<title>I cannot urinate just after the birth - what should I do?</title>
<body>If you haven't been able to urinate within six hours of the birth, there may be a problem. It is best to go to the clinic to get help. 
Usually your kidneys filter out waste from your blood and send it to your bladder as urine. It waits there until you are ready to empty your bladder. Healthy urine is very pale yellow.
If your bladder feels full but you can't go, you need help at the clinic. You may also have pain low in your tummy. At the clinic, staff  may use a short tube to help you empty your bladder. They will also do tests to find out what's wrong.
 If the  clinic staff givestaff gives you any medicines, be sure to finish them even if you feel better. They will help you to recover. It is also a good idea to keep drinking lots of water. Do this even if it is painful to urinate. Drinking helps to flush away infection.

<title>My tummy feels tender just after the birth - what should I do?</title>
<body>Every mum feels a little bit sore after birth, but if this area is really painful, don't be afraid to ask for help at the clinic.  It can be a sign of an infection.
 If you had a caesarean, your tummy stitches may have become infected. Or you could have an infection in your womb. When the placenta comes away from the womb after the baby is born, it leaves a wound that needs to heal.  If the wound gets infected, it won't be able to heal. This means that it will keep bleeding and your tummy will feel very sore. 
At the clinic, staff will check you over and will advise and reassure you. If you have an infection, they will give you the right medicine. Make sure you take all of the medicine. Not finishing all the medicine could mean that the infection comes back.
If your tummy feels very tender, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to find out what is wrong.

<title>My discharge after the birth is smelly - what should I do?</title>
<body>If your discharge is smelly, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to help you.
Some bleeding is normal after birth. This blood should smell no worse than your normal period. But if it smells bad or fishy, you may have an infection in your womb or vagina.  If an infection in the womb prevents healing, it can cause heavy bleeding. Go to the clinic straight away if you notice your discharge is smelly.
At the clinic, staff will take samples of the discharge and see if there is an infection. If you do have an infection they will treat it. Take all the medicines they give you. It is the best way to get fully better.
You can help your recovery by keeping the area outside your vagina clean and dry. Use plain soap. Don't try to clean inside as you might make any infection worse. Change your pads or cloths often, and wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes.  This will keep you cool and comfortable.

<title>It stings badly when I urinate- what should I do?</title>
<body>If it hurts to urinate, or you have a lot of pain in your vagina and bottom, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to help you.
Staff will find out what is causing the stinging, and treat it. Take all the medicine they give you to get fully recoverrid of the infection fully.
There are a few reasons why it may hurt to urinate. 
It could mean that you have a urine infection. This could also turn your urine smelly or cloudy. 
If you have a lot of pain in your vagina and back passage, it could be because your stitches are infected.  This will make the area very sore and it will sting when you urinate.
Pain in your vagina could also mean that there is bruising inside you where you can't see it.
To ease the pain, take a jug or bottle of clean water to the toilet and pour it over the area as you urinate. Or urinate in the bath, just before you get out. Fresh urine is clean, so it will not hurt you. Drinking plenty of water will also help.

<title>Why is breastfeeding best for my baby?</title>
<body>A breastfed baby is much less likely to be ill in his first year of life than a baby without breastmilk. Your breastmilk helps him fight off germs and illnesses. Breastfeeding can be lifesaving for your baby!
Breastfeeding gives your baby the best start in life. Breastmilk is a complete food and contains everything your baby needs to grow and be healthy. Your baby needs nothing else for the first six months. 
Your milk changes during a feed. The first part of a feed is a watery, sugary milk called foremilk. This satisfies your baby's thirst and gives him the energy he needs to feed well. Later in the feed, your milk has a more fat in it. This is called hind milk. It makes your baby feel full, helps him grow and lets him settle to sleep. 
Your body is very clever. You make different milk for your newborn baby than you do for your six-month-old or one-year-old. If your baby is born early, you will make milk that is just right for an extra small baby. And if you have twins, your body makes enough milk for both of them!
Breastfeeding can also be a peaceful and soothing experience which you can share with your baby.

<title>Why is breastfeeding best for me?</title>
<body>It's not just your baby who benefits from breastfeeding. It's very good for you, too. It helps make sure your womb shrinks back to its usual size after the birth and reduces bleeding. It can also lower your risk of getting some kinds of cancer and protect you against weak bones when you are older.
Breastfeeding saves money. You don't have to buy special baby milks or powders. Plus, you don't have to buy bottles or teats. 
Breastfeeding is very easy. You don't have to make up feeds or clean bottles. Your milk is always ready whenever your baby needs it. 
Breastfeeding is safe. Making up milks and cleaning bottles can allow germs to get into the feed. Your breastmilk is always perfectly clean.
Breastfeeding can help space your family. If you feed your baby only breastmilk for the first six months, it can help prevent your periods returning. That means you are not releasing eggs and you are unlikely to get pregnant. 
Breastfeeding gives you a rest when you sit down to feed, and lets you have a special time with your baby.

<title>Does the size of my breasts affect the amount of milk I make?</title>
<body>No! Breasts come in many sizes and are all designed to feed babies. While you are pregnant, your breasts will change as they get ready to feed your baby.  You don't have to do anything to prepare them...it all happens naturally. 
The size of your breasts shows how much fat there is in them, that's all! Every woman's breasts have the milk glands needed to make milk. You will always be able to make the right amount of milk for your baby. If you have a tiny baby, you make less milk. If you have a big baby, you make more.  
Most women find their breasts get bigger during pregnancy. Many women find that some of the clothes they used to wear are tight across their breasts, especially towards the end of pregnancy. If you wear a bra, you might have to get a bigger size. 
When you start breastfeeding, a nursing bra can help to support your bigger breasts. If you don't wear a bra, wear clothes that can be easily undone from your neck. This will make it easier for you to feed your baby if you don't want to show a lot of your breasts.

<title>Will breastfeeding change the shape of my breasts?</title>
<body>It is pregnancy that changes the shape of your breasts, not breastfeeding. When you are pregnant, your breasts get larger. This is because they are preparing to feed your baby.
Shortly after your baby is born, your breasts will feel fuller and heavier. Your heart is pumping more blood to your breasts to make lots of milk. 

The muscles on your chest which support your breasts are quite thin. They stretch as your breasts grow, and may make your breasts slightly droopy. This will happen whether you breastfeed your baby or not. 

For the first few weeks of breastfeeding, your breasts may feel very full, heavy and large. As your milk supply settles down, you will find that your breasts get a bit smaller and slightly softer. They will usually stay the same size until you stop breastfeeding. If your body returns to the same size you were before pregnancy, then your breasts will probably return to their pre-pregnancy size, too. 

If your breasts are heavy and you are finding them uncomfortable, consider wearing a bra. A soft cotton bra with wide shoulder straps is best. Or use a long scarf to wind round them to give support.

<title>Do breastfed babies need water?</title>
<body>If you are breastfeeding your baby, you do not need to give her any water, or anything else. The milk you make is all she needs. 
Breastfed babies do not need extra water in hot weather. When it's hot, your baby will feed more often, for less time. By feeding this way, she will get extra foremilk. Foremilk is thinner and more refreshing than the fatty hind milk. Foremilk is the milk your breasts produce at the start of each feed. 
Breastmilk is itself mostly made of water. If you breastfeed your baby little and often whenever she wants, she will get plenty of water from your breastmilk.
If you replace breastmilk with water, your babyshe will not get the good things that are in your breastmilk.  
Your breastmilk helps your baby fight germs.  Losing milk will make her more likely to become ill. Your breastmilk also helps her grow, so less milk may slow down her growth.  
Keep your baby safe and healthy - only give her your breastmilk.

<title>Do I need to eat more while I am breastfeeding?</title>
<body>Breastfeeding can make you very hungry! You will need to eat a little more than you normally would.
Your body is very good at making milk, but if you don't eat enough you may feel tired and faint. 
Try to eat three main meals a day at regular times.  If you can't, eat plenty of snacks throughout the day. Healthy snacks will help to keep up your energy levels. You don't have to wait for a big meal. Good snacks to try are dried fruit, nuts, seeds, fresh fruit and vegetables and seeds.
Breastfeeding can make you feel thirsty, too. Have a drink before you feed your baby. Plain water is good, or juice diluted with clean water. You don't have to drink milk to make milk, but you do need to drink plenty of fluids. Don't drink too much coffee or fizzy drinks. Just one or two glasses of these a day is enough. 
If you don't feel like eating, it could be a sign that you need extra support. If it is a struggle to eat, and you are forcing yourself, talk to clinic staff. They may be able to give you some treatment to help.

<title>Do I need to drink more while I am breastfeeding?</title>
<body>Many women feel thirsty while they are breastfeeding. So you may have to drink more. 
While you are feeding your baby, your body releases a hormone that makes you feel thirsty. Listen to your body and drink if you are thirsty. Perhaps have some water before you feed your baby.
However, do not force yourself to drink if you are not thirsty. You may have been told that you should drink lots of water to increase your milk supply. This is not true; drinking more will not affect the amount of milk you make. Your body will make enough milk for your baby, no matter how much you drink.
If you are worried that you are not drinking enough water, look at the colour of your urine. If it is pale coloured, you are getting plenty to drink. If your urine is dark yellow or smells strongly, it may mean that you need to drink more.

<title>What are good foods to eat while breastfeeding?</title>
<body>You do not have to eat any particular foods while you are breastfeeding your baby. But you will benefit from eating a wide variety of foods. This will be good for your health, and will give you more energy to take care of your baby!
Try to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Pulses and carbohydrates are also good. These include rice, beans, lentils, chickpeas, bread and mealies. Eat lean meat and fish, too. Try not to eat fatty fried foods or sweets. These may give you a quick burst of energy, but it won't last. They will make you feel more tired than ever! Fatty and sugary foods can give you mood swings, too. Eating healthily will give you lots of energy, and make you feel good.
Eating healthily will help your baby as well. She will get lots of vitamins through your milk. You are also setting a good example for your baby when she gets older!

<title>Can I drink alcohol while breastfeeding?</title>
<body>Drinking alcohol is not advised in breastfeeding. Alcohol enters your bloodstream and goes into your breastmilk. This means that if you drink alcohol, your baby will be drinking it, too!
If you want to drink alcohol, don't have much. Just have one or two glasses a week. If your favourite drink is strong, you could replace it with something weaker: such as beer instead of vodka.
If you are going to drink alcohol, try not to drink right before a feed. Drinking alcohol at least two hours before a feed will reduce the levels of alcohol in your milk. 
Perhaps feed your baby first and have a drink afterwards. Two or three hours later, the level of alcohol in your breastmilk will be very low. But if your baby is newborn, she will need feeding more often, so try not to drink alcohol.
Drinking water won't help your body get rid of the alcohol any faster. Expressing your milk and then throwing it away won't work either. You'll just waste milk!
It's best for you and your baby if you don't drink alcohol. You probably weren't drinking during pregnancy - keep up the good work!

<title>Are there any foods I should avoid eating while I am breastfeeding?</title>
<body>There are no rules about what to eat or not to eat. You can eat anything in small amounts.
But every mother and baby is different. Some types of food and drink may unsettle your baby's tummy. This can make him fussy and miserable. Some babies also get colic. Colic has many causes; sometimes it is unrelated to your eating habits. 
To find out if your baby's colic is caused by food, you'll need to stop eating certain foods for a few days. Then you can see if your baby feels any better. Common causes of colic include leafy green vegetables, cauliflower and onions. Cow's milk and chocolate have also been known to cause colic. Sometimes spicy food can upset babies, too.
If you think you have found the problem food, you could try not to eat it until your baby is a few months older. Colic does not usually affect older babies.
The important thing is that you have lots of different foods and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. This will keep you and baby healthy.

<title>Is it safe to use herbs to help with my milk supply?</title>
<body>Some women think that certain herbs will help them to make more milk. There is no evidence which proves this. But many herbs have health benefits and certainly won't harm you or your baby. 
You can drink most herbal teas while you are breastfeeding. Herbal teas which use ingredients you might cook with are safe to drink. Red bush tea and honey bush tea are also safe to drink, and have many health benefits.

Be careful when taking herbal medicines. Some medicines will not be safe for your baby. If you want to take something, check with your clinic first. 
The best way to make more milk is to feed your baby as often as possible. The more your baby drinks, the more milk you will make. Let your baby feed whenever she wants. It may also help if you try to express left over milk after feeds. This may sound strange, but doing this encourages your breasts to make more milk.
If you are worried that you're not making enough milk, ask your clinic staff for advice.

<title>Breastfeeding - how do I get started?</title>
<body>First, pour yourself a cup of water, and put it where you can reach it. Breastfeeding can make you thirsty. 
Then find a comfortable place to sit, where you can hold your baby in a position that won't make your arms and back ache. Make sure that your back is supported and that you are not leaning back. 
Have some pillows or blankets nearby to help you to support your baby. Try different positions. Many mothers find cradling their baby across their chest, raised up on a cushion or pillow, works well. Do what's most comfortable for you. 
When you're both in a relaxed position, it's time to get your baby ‘latched on' and feeding.
Your baby's feed can take anything from five5 to 40 minutes. If you find noise distracting, find somewhere quiet. If you get bored, try feeding with the radio on or sit with a friend for company.

<title>How do I latch my baby onto my breast?</title>
<body>To feed well, your baby needs to use her tongue to scoop in a big mouthful of your breast.  
When you are both comfortable, bring your baby to your breast with her head tipped back. She should be leading with her chin. With her head tipped back, let her lips touch your nipple.
Your baby will then drop her lower jaw. As soon as you see this, move her quickly and smoothly to your breast. Aim her bottom lip as far away from the base of your nipple as you can. As you move your baby, watch her lower lip. Try not to worry about her top lip and if it will get over your nipple.  
When you feel your baby's tongue sucking smoothly and rhythmically under your breast, you know your baby is latched on.

<title>How does latching on work?</title>
<body>Scooping a big mouthful of breast and 'latching on' lets your baby draw your breast deeply into his mouth. 
Your nipple will then be right at the back of his mouth, where the roof of his mouth is softer. He can use his tongue to massage under your breast. This gentle action brings out your milk. 
Your baby's jaw will move up and down, and he will swallow your milk as it flows to the back of his mouth. This shouldn't hurt you! Your nipple will be so far back in his mouth he cannot squash or pinch it with his tongue.
Breastfeeding shouldn't be painful or uncomfortable for you. If it is, gently put a finger between your baby's gums and your nipple and try again. Once your baby latches on well, he can do the rest of the work. 
If your baby is sucking smoothly and seems contented, you've probably got it right. Well done! Remember, you are doing the best for your baby.

<title>How do I know my baby is well latched  on?</title>
<body>It is easy to tell if your baby is well latched-on. 
You will be able to feel your baby's tongue massaging the underside of your breast. She will draw out the milk smoothly and gently.  She will also lie contented in your arms. 
If she is well-latched on, you'll be able to see and hear her swallowing. She may pause from time to time and let go. Let your nipple brush her lips and start again. Let her set her own pace. She'll stop feeding when she's ready.
If you are uncomfortable, start again. Pain while breastfeeding is a sign that your baby is not latched-on properly. Put your little finger in your baby's mouth to loosen the nipple and have another try. 
Supporting your baby will help her latch on too. Try putting your palm behind your baby's shoulders and your index finger and thumb behind her ears. Or try cradling your baby's head in your whole hand.

<title>How should I hold my baby to feed?</title>
<body>When breastfeeding you need to be comfortable and have your baby in a good position. 
Here are some positions you can try:
With a pillow or cushion on your lap, cradle your baby in either arm. 
If you had a caesarean, you may prefer to hold your baby under one arm with his legs behind you. This way he won't be able to kick you in the tummy. 
You could also try lying on your side in bed, facing your baby. You might need somebody to help with the pillows. Don't do this if you have drunk alcohol or if you are very sleepy. There's a chance that you could fall asleep and roll on top of your baby.
Whatever position you choose, make sure your baby can tip his head back slightly and get a good mouthful of breast.  This will help him to latch on. Once you are comfortable, let your baby do the work. You don't need to move him around your breast.

<title>How long does it take for my milk to come through?</title>
<body>Your milk won't come through straight away. This is because your body needs to start making different hormones to provide your baby with milk. Around two or three days after you give birth your breasts will start to feel full. This is a sign that your milk is coming in.
This does not mean that you won't have any milk to feed your baby straight away. During your pregnancy your breasts begin making rich, creamy milk called colostrum. Some mothers leak a little of this milk before their baby is born. In the days before your milk comes in, colostrum will give your baby all the goodness she needs.  Don't waste this precious milk by expressing it. It is the best food for your newborn baby.

You can offer your baby your breast as soon she's born. Let your baby feed as often as she wants. This will keep your milk supply going so that your baby gets lots of delicious milk.

<title>Why should I feed my baby the first milk?</title>
<body>Your main supply of breastmilk starts flowing after three or four days. Before this, your breasts make a first milk called colostrum. You might have noticed some of this milk coming from your breasts before you had your baby. 
Colostrum is creamy and rich and contains everything your baby needs.  You can't buy all this goodness in a jar. Only your body can make it for your baby.
Colostrum helps your baby fight off germs that cause infection.  ItYou can help to protect your baby from a wide range of illnesses.  These include tummy bugs, breathing problems and ear infections. Babies who are born early can grow and thrive if they have their mother's first milk.
Colostrum is often thick and yellow coloured. This is normal. You may have heard that this milk is dirty. But the yellow colour is just a sign that it is full of creamy goodness. 
To give your baby the best start in life; let him have all the colostrum you make in the early days.

<title>How do I know my baby is getting enough milk?</title>
<body>If your baby is feeding at least six to eight times a day, and you are comfortable feeding her, she is probably getting enough milk. You'll be able to see her swallow while she is feeding, and your breasts will feel emptier and softer after feeds.

Another good sign is if your baby changes rhythm while sucking, and pauses during feeds. She should start feeding again when she's ready, and come off your breast when she wants to.

Your baby's nappies can also show if your baby is getting enough milk. Her stools should be a yellowy-mustard colour and she should pass them at least once a day. When you change her nappy, her urine should be pale and have no smell. She should have at least six to eight wet nappies every day. 

A baby who gets enough milk will also have firm, healthy coloured skin that bounces back when lightly pinched.  

If you are worried that your baby isn't getting enough milk, ask staff at the clinic. They will be able to check that your baby is healthy.

<title>How do I know my baby is not getting enough milk?</title>
<body>One of the hardest things about breastfeeding is feeling confident that you're giving your baby enough milk. 
After he's five days old, your baby should be wetting around six to eight nappies a day, and passing stools once a day. If your baby is not doing this, he may not be getting enough milk. Small, dark stools can be a sign that something is wrong. 
His skin should be filling out and his face should be rounded after around three weeks. If his skin stays wrinkly, it means he is not getting enough to eat. 
Your baby will probably tell you when he's unhappy. He will be unsettled after feeds and may want to be at your breast all the time. If he has dimples in his cheeks or makes clicking noises while breastfeeding, he may not be latched on well. You might also notice that your breasts don't feel softer after feeds. 
If your baby shows any of these signs, ask for help at your clinic. Clinic staff will weigh and check your baby.  If you're still not sure that you are feeding your baby well, they can help you get it right.

<title>What can I do if I don't have enough milk?</title>
<body>The more you feed your baby, the more milk your breasts will make.  Let your baby guide you, and feed him whenever he wants.  
If your baby is very sleepy, you may need to wake him and gently encourage him to feed more often. This will stimulate your breasts to make more milk. 
Your baby may lose weight when he's weighed during his first few days. This is normal and usually doesn't mean he's not getting enough milk.
You may start to make less milk if you don't breastfeed often. For example, if your nipples are sore and feeding hurts, you might want to stop before your baby has finished. You may also make less milk if you try to set a routine, instead of feeding your baby when he wants it. 
There are easy ways to tell if your baby is getting enough milk. Find out here:

<title>What can Ii do if Ii have too much milk?</title>
<body>Sometimes if you have lots of milk, it can start to leak and spray before your baby can get to your breast. Your baby may struggle to start feeding and come off your breast. She may cough and splutter if she can't swallow fast enough. She may also refuse your breast and become upset. 

This may upset you, too. But don't worry. It probably won't be long before you and your baby settle into a routine that's comfortable for both of you. It just takes a little while for your breasts to adjust to your baby's needs. 

Check that your baby can latch on well. It can be a bit of a struggle for her to get a good mouthful of breast when your milk is leaking and spraying. 

You can slow down this flow by expressing a small amount of milk before each feed.  Or, when your baby starts to suckle, gently move her off the breast and catch the first drops in a towel. Let your baby latch on again, when your flow slows down a bit.

<title>How can I tell if my baby is dehydrated? </title>
<body>There are many signs of dehydration. Dry skin or lips, fewer wet nappies than normal and dark yellow urine are some of the clearest signs. You should also look out for sunken spots on the top of your baby's head. Tiredness, tearless crying and fast breathing are also signs of dehydration.
If your baby is dehydrated, it means he's losing too much fluid or not taking in enough. Dehydration is common in babies and young children. This is because they are smaller and more delicate than adults.
Dehydration needs to be sorted quickly or it can become more serious.
If you think your baby is showing signs of dehydration, make sure he gets lots of fluids. Your breastmilk is an ideal drink. Keeping your baby out of the heat and sun will also help.  If your baby is over six months, try giving him lots of clean water, too. You could also get an ORS solution from the clinic. This will help to replace his fluids.
If your baby gets very dehydrated, go to the clinic. The staff there will give him the fluids he needs.

<title>Why is it good to express breastmilk?</title>
<body>Expressing your milk means that your baby can still have the benefits of breastmilk even if you are away from him. He can carry on enjoying your milk while someone else is caring for him, and other people in your family can enjoy the closeness of feeding him.
If you're away from your baby for a long time, expressing will stop your breasts becoming too full and uncomfortable.
An early baby can also be helped with expressed milk. He may be too small and weak to suckle at first. By expressing your milk, you can give him the food he needs. 
Expressing is also a great way to increase your milk supply. The more milk that leaves your breasts, the more your breasts will make.

<title>How do I express my breastmilk?</title>
<body>Wash your hands and find a jug or bowl for your milk. Wash it well and rinse with boiling water to kill any germs. Get yourself comfortable, just as if you were breastfeeding your baby.
Place your little finger underneath your breast, against your ribs. With your thumb and first finger, make a big C shape around your breast. Gently squeeze your thumb and first finger together, count to three, and release. Keep your finger and thumb in the same position.
Massage your breast gently and smoothly behind your nipple to stimulate the milk ducts deep inside your breasts. If you just squeeze the nipple, you won't get any milk. It may hurt too! 
Keep squeezing and releasing until you see milk appearing at your nipple. Be patient, it may take a while.
Express the milk by continuing to massage your breast, gently and smoothly.  Change breasts when the flow slows down.        
Express each breast twice.  If it all seems a bit of a fuss, remember that there are many good reasons for expressing your milk.

<title>How do I store expressed breastmilk?</title>
<body>To store expressed breastmilk, you will a need a cup, bowl or other container. You also need a lid, plate or clean piece of cloth to cover and seal the container.
Before you begin to express your milk, wash your hands well with hot water and soap. This will help to keep germs away.
Next, you need to clean your container. Wash it well in hot water with soap and rinse it with boiling water. This will kill any germs and will help you to store your milk safely.
After expressing your milk into the container, cover it with a clean lid, plate or cloth. This will keep insects, dust and germs out of your milk.
Find a cool place to store your milk. You can put it in a fridge if you have one. If not, try to find a place in your home that is away from any heat or sunlight. You can keep breastmilk in this cool place for up to six hours.

<title>I have a small white dot on the end of my nipple - what is it?</title>
<body>If you have a small white dot on the end of your nipple, then you probably have a blocked duct.
Blocked ducts are usually caused by a back-up of milk in your breasts. This happens when your baby does not drain your breasts when he feeds. This causes the milk ducts (which your breastmilk flows through) to become blocked by the milk that your baby didn't drink.
Blocked ducts are easily treated. If you have one, you can usually remove it by piercing the end of it with a clean fingernail or sterile needle. Do this after your baby has fed, when the skin on your nipple is softer. Wash your hands well with soap and clean water first. If you are using a needle, sterilise it by holding it in a flame for a few seconds.
A blocked milk duct is often confused with a condition called mastitis. You may get a lump in your breast, with a red, sore patch on the skin. This is often called a blocked duct. In fact, the duct is not blocked, but the tissue around it has become swollen and is pressing on the duct instead. 

Real blocked ducts are rare and tend to happen weeks or months into breastfeeding.

<title>Why do my breasts hurt for the first few seconds of a feed?</title>
<body>You may feel a quick pain in your breasts when you first start to breastfeed your baby.  This is because your breast muscles have to squeeze out milk.
For some mums, this squeezing feeling is only mildly uncomfortable, or they don't notice it at all. But others feel heavy pressure and pain. As time goes by and you get used to breastfeeding, you'll probably get less and less aware of it.

If your breasts are very hard and full, your baby may not be able to latch on well enough to feed properly. You may need to express a little milk until your breast is softer. Your baby will then be able to draw your breast into his mouth more easily. 
The more often your baby latches on well, the quicker your supply will settle down and you should be more comfortable. 
If your breast pain does not go away within a few days, ask staff at your clinic for advice.

<title>Why are my nipples sore?</title>
<body>You may think that sore nipples are just something that you have to put up with when you are breastfeeding.  But you don't!  Breastfeeding should not be painful or uncomfortable for you.
Your nipples are probably sore because of the way your baby is breastfeeding. Your baby may not be latching on well if she has to suck or pull your nipple into her mouth.  She needs to scoop a large mouthful of your breast into her mouth so that her tongue can stimulate the flow of milk. 
If your baby doesn't open her mouth wide to take in your breast, gently insert your finger into the corner of her mouth and above her tongue. Take her from your breast and start again. 
If your nipples are very sore, cracked, or bleeding, ask staff at the clinic for some treatment. You should also go to the clinic if there are white areas in the folds of your nipples - this is a sign of thrush. It may be best to express your milk and cup-feed your baby until your nipples have healed.

<title>My breasts are full of milk and feel hard and painful- what can I do?</title>
<body>As your body starts making breastmilk, your breasts begin to get full of milk. They may feel swollen and hard. If you keep breastfeeding your baby, your breasts will soften and feel more comfortable. 
If your breasts stay full for several days, it could be that your baby can't keep up with the amount of milk you are making. This could happen because he hasn't learnt to latch on well and isn't taking in enough milk at each feed. Make sure he has a big mouthful of breast when he feeds. If your breast is too full, your baby may find it hard to latch on. If so, ityou may help to express a little milk until your breasts are softer. 
Don't try and set a routine for your baby, but feed him as often as he wants. Look out for signs he's asking to be fed, such as sucking his fist or becoming restless.  
After the feed, you may find it helps to cool your breasts with cold wet cloths.

<title>I have a hot red area on my breast -what is it?</title>
<body>If an area of your breast feels hot, red or sore, you may have a painful condition called mastitis. Mastitis can make you feel ill. You may have flu-like symptoms such as chills, headaches or a fever. This will clear up quickly with treatment. Mastitis can get worse if your breasts get infected, so get to your clinic for treatment and advice as soon as you can. 
Mastitis usually happens because your baby isn't emptying your breasts when she feeds. This may be because she isn't latched on properly.
Mastitis gets better if the milk is flowing through your breasts. So don't stop feeding, as this will make it worse. See that your baby gets a good mouthful of breast. Try different breastfeeding positions to help her latch on.
If you feel your baby is not feeding well, expressing your milk may helps. 
To soothe the pain, some mothers find that it helps to put warm cloths on their breasts after a feed. Others prefer cold cloths. See which works for you.

<title>My baby has white spots in her mouth - what are they?</title>
<body>If your baby has white spots in her mouth, then she probably has thrush.
Thrush is a common yeast infection. Your baby's mouth is moist when she is feeding. It's the perfect place for thrush to grow. 
Thrush forms white spots that look like milk. They could be inside her cheeks, on the roof of her mouth, on her gums or on her tongue. Thrush does not wipe away. 
This infection won't harm your baby. But it may make her unhappy. She could get dehydrated if her mouth is too sore to feed. Thrush can also cause nappy rash if it moves down her digestive system to her bottom.
Thrush might pass from your baby's mouth to your breasts. This may cause your nipples to become cracked, red or shiny, with white areas in the folds. They may be itchy and sensitive. They might be sore after breastfeeding, or feel like they are burning.
Thrush can make breastfeeding painful, but don't stop.
Take your baby to the clinic. You will both need to be treated for thrush. Otherwise, you could keep catching it from each other!

<title>How can I treat thrush?</title>
<body>Thrush usually goes away by itself in a few weeks. 
But don't wait if breastfeeding is painful, or if your baby doesn't want to feed. Go to your clinic. Staff there can give you medicine or cream to help clear up the infection. 
They may give you a gel to put in your baby's mouth. Using a clean finger, apply a little of the gel to the infected areas. 
You may also need to put some on his bottom if thrush has spread. Always wash your hands each time you've finished treating your baby. This stops thrush spreading. 
You will need to wash everything that might go into your baby's mouth, such as dummies and spoons. 
If you're breastfeeding, you will need to be treated too, even if you don't have symptoms. This will stop you passing the infection back to your baby.
It may take a week of treatment. Tell staff at the clinic if the medicine or cream does not help. You should also go to the clinic if your baby feels very hot. This could mean he has a different infection.

<title>How can I prevent thrush?</title>
<body>Sometimes there is nothing you can do to prevent thrush. Many babies catch the infection from their mothers as they are being born. 
Other babies can get it during breastfeeding. Their mouths are warm and wet, which thrush needs to grow.

Some babies are just more likely to get it than other babies.
There are a few things you can do to prevent your baby getting thrush.  
Clean anything she might put in her mouth with soap and water. This includes dummies, cups and teething rings. Scrub your baby's clothes in water to make sure that they don't carry the infection. 
If you're breastfeeding, wash your nipples with water and dry them well between feeds.
A hungry baby who finds it painful to feed would make any mother worried. Remember that thrush won't last long. Give your baby all the comfort she needs, and follow the advice of staff at your clinic.

<title>How can I stop my baby biting during feeds?</title>
<body>A baby who bites while feeding can cause you pain. Your baby's new teeth are sharp and are bound to hurt. Your first reaction might shock your baby so much that he won't do it again. But your baby may also be curious and repeat the bite to see what happens. It may turn into a game for him. 

If your baby does bite you, stop feeding him. Your baby needs to link biting with losing your breast. Stay calm, make eye contact and say "no" firmly. If your baby keeps biting, put him away from you for a short time straight after he bites.

It will also help if you learn when your baby has finished feeding and when he is really hungry. Babies who are full or not hungry may start to play with your breast out of boredom.

If your baby is already on solids, give him a hard piece of bread before or after a feed. This can help, too.

Slowly, your baby will learn and you will have pain-free feeding again.

<title>How long should I breastfeed for?</title>
<body>It's best if you breastfeed your baby for two years. Breastmilk has a lot of nutrients to help your baby grow, and antibodies to help your baby fight illnesses. 
For the first six months, your breastmilk is all your baby needs for a healthy start in life. Don't give her anything else. 
After six months, your growing baby will need more. Start her on solids while continuing to breastfeed her. 
Keep breastfeeding her till she is two years old. 
However, for some HIV+ mothers, it is safer for you and your baby to stop breastfeeding after one year.  Talk to staff at your clinic to find out what is best.
If you need to go back to work, you don't have to stop breastfeeding. You can express breastmilk for someone else to give her. You can then breastfeed her as normal when you are home. This may make you feel better about being away from your baby during the day.

<title>What does exclusive breastfeeding mean?</title>
<body>Exclusive breastfeeding means feeding your baby only breastmilk and nothing else.
Your baby needs to be exclusively breastfed for the first six months. Your breastmilk contains everything she needs to give her a healthy start in life.
After six months, breastfeeding will not be enough. She will need additional nutrients from solids. 
During the first six months, it's important to feed your baby nothing but breastmilk. Starting her on solids earlier than six months can cause:
Infections: Your baby's immune system is not strong enough to fight germs that may come through handling and preparing food. Your breastmilk comes straight from the breast and is germ-free.
Allergies: Your baby may develop an allergic reaction to certain foods tried too early. Exclusive breastfeeding for six months prepares your baby for the solid foods that will follow.  
Feeding your baby any other milk will reduce the goodness of breastmilk. There is also a greater risk of infections from other types of milk.

<title>Why does exclusive breastfeeding matter?</title>
<body>Exclusive breastfeeding matters because it helps your baby stay healthy. Your breastmilk is all your baby needs for the first six months. She does not need solid food before six months. She does not need any other type of milk, either.
Your breastmilk is special. It changes as your baby grows. The first milk that you make after the birth,birth is thick and high in vitamins and antibodies.
Your milk then changes to become whiter and less thick. This satisfies her thirst, so she doesn't even need water if the weather is hot. Your milk changes to meet your baby's needs.
A breastfed baby is much less likely to be ill in her first year of life. You'll be helping her fight off germs and illnesses in her tummy, lungs, bladder, skin and ears.
In fact, breastfeeding is the reason that you have breasts - so that you can feed your baby!
After six months, your growing baby needs more than breastmilk can offer. But continue breastfeeding her while she tries solid food.

<title>When should I offer my baby other foods?</title>
<body>It is best to wait until your baby is six months old before starting her on solids. If she is younger than six months, then she only needs your breastmilk. This is even more important is she was born early.
If your baby is older than 6 months, then she might be ready to start solids if:
<ul>
<li>She can sit up straight on your lap, and hold her head.</li>
<li>She moves her mouth as if chewing, and dribbles less. This means that she can move food to the back of her mouth to swallow. She is practising!</li>
<li>She is curious about what you're eating. If she reaches for your food, then she may be ready!</li>
</ul>
If you see any of these signs, she's probably ready for solids.

<title>What  foods should I offer my baby?</title>
<body>Offer your baby only a tiny amount of food at first. Start by offering food to your baby before or after a milk feed, or in the middle of a feed if it works better. Pick a time that's good for you both. 
Try offering your baby one or two spoonfuls of:
<ul>
<li>mashed vegetables such as sweet potato or yam</li>
<li>mashed beans</li>
<li>mashed fruit, such as banana or mango</li>
</ul>
You could also try baby rice, sago, maize, cornmeal, millet, pap or mielie. You can mix these with some of your breastmilk.
As your baby gets used to these foods, start to add other foods. Give her meat, fish, beans and nuts. They contain protein, which your baby needs to grow well. Crush nuts, to stop her choking. 
Slowly increase the number of times she has solid food in a day. When your baby is about seven months old, she should be eating solids three times a day. Continue breastfeeding your baby, in addition to giving her solid food.

<title>What foods shouldn't I give to my baby?</title>
<body>Your baby's tummy and digestive system are still growing. There are some foods that he should not eat until he is a year old. It's always best to give him one new food at a time. Then, if he is unwell, you can stop feeding him that food and try again when he is older.
 When your baby starts on solids, do not give him any of these things:
Cow's milk, cheese or yoghurt. Dairy products are difficult for your baby to digest. This is also the same with eggs, until he is nine months old.
Citrus fruits - this includes oranges, grapefruit and fruit juices. They are too acidic and could make your baby unwell.
Tea, coffee and sugary drinks. Caffeine is bad for children, and the sugars in the drinks are unhealthy. 
Salt and spicy foods. Your baby doesn't need them. He will prefer plain food that is not too flavourful.
Finally, it would be best not to give your baby honey until he is one year old. Honey can contain harmful bacteria that can make babies ill.

<title>How can I prepare foods for my baby safely?</title>
<body>You can help keep your baby healthy by checking that everything in your kitchen or cooking area is clean. 
Here are some tips for storing, preparing and serving food safely:
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands well, using water and soap. Dry your hands on a clean towel or cloth.</li>
<li>Clean cooking equipment and areas where food will be prepared.</li>
<li>Wipe up any spills straight away.</li>
<li>Clean your baby's spoon and plate with boiling water.</li>
<li>Store and prepare raw meat separately to all other foods. Wrap it well and don't let it touch other foods. After preparing it, wash any equipment you have used. Make sure foodit is totally cooked before it is eaten.</li>
<li>Be with your baby while she is eating solid foods in case she chokesas she may choke.</li>
<li>Do not chew food for your baby. Instead, mash it with a spoon or fork.</li>
<li>Always serve your food freshly cooked. Food that has been been cooked a while ago can contain germs.</li>

<title>What checks will staff at the clinic give my newborn?</title>
<body>Your baby will have a few checks in the first hours of his life. The clinic staff will check if your baby is healthy. Sometimes a baby has an immediate problem that needs to be treated. 
Most babies are fine. Some need to be watched for a while. If your baby does need some help, a midwife may give him oxygen. This clears his airways and helps him to breathe.
Next, the clinic staff will weigh your baby. They will check his temperature and measure the size of his head. 
The next time you go to the clinic, these checks will be done again. This is to make sure that your baby is growing well. 
Up to 48 hours after the birth, the staff at the clinic might do a more thorough check. They might examine his head, ears, eyes, mouth, heart, lungs, genitals, spine, hips, hands and feet. This is to make sure he doesn't need special care.

<title>What do birthmarks look like?</title>
<body>There are lots of different birthmarks.  Most will fade away as your baby grows, but others are permanent. 

Some birthmarks are blue or green in colour. Some look like bruises while others are lumpy. Bruise-like marks are called mongolian spots. They may appear on your baby's back or bottom. They should go by the time your baby is four or five years old. 

Some babies get marks that look like moles. Your baby can have them at birth. These moles will be almost black, and can be raised and hairy. They are most likely to appear on your baby's torso, particularly on his back. They can get smaller as your baby grows but can also darken.

Red marks are also common. Some are raised and can appear on your baby's skin within a few days or weeks of birth. They should disappear before he is seven years old. 

Flat red or purple marks can also appear on your baby's face. They may fade, but can get bigger and darker.

Lots of babies also have light brown patches. Others get pale pink ones. These usually appear around your baby's face and head. They often fade.

Birthmarks do not harm or hurt your baby. You should not try to treat them in any way.

<title>What will my newborn baby's head look like?</title>
<body>When you first see your baby, he may not look how you expected. If you had a vaginal birth, your baby's head may look a bit squashed and pointy. But, this is quite normal. As your baby was born, his head was squeezed as he moved through your vagina. Your baby's head will soon grow into a normal shape and he will start to look like the baby you dreamed about. 
If you had a caesarean, your baby will have a rounder face.
Your baby has soft spots on his skull called fontanelles. He has them so that his head can be squeezed when he is being born, so that he can fit through the birth canal. The fontanelle at the back takes about four months to close. The front one takes between nine9 and 18 months. 
Keep an eye on your baby's fontanelles. They can give important clues about his health. Take your baby to the clinic if his fontanelles seem to be sunken or bulging.

<title>What will my newborn baby's skin look like?</title>
<body>All babies are different. How your baby's skin looks can depend on when she was born.
If she was born early, her skin may look thin. You might be able to see her veins. She could also be covered with a fine, downy hair called lanugo. Your baby will slowly shed this hair.
She may also still be covered with a greasy white fluid called vernix. This protected her skin when she was floating in your womb.
If your baby was on time or late, she will probably have only a tiny bit of vernix and lanugo on her skin.
Your baby might also be born with birthmarks. These are different coloured patches of skin, and they are harmless. Most fade away, but some are permanent.
About half of all babies are born with white dots on their faces. These are called milia, and they look like tiny pimples. They will disappear in time.
Try not to compare your baby with others. Your baby is one of a kind!

<title>What will my newborn baby's genitals look like?</title>
<body>A baby boy has a penis and a scrotum. The scrotum is the bag of wrinkly skin that contains his testicles. 
Don't worry if his penis and scrotum look swollen or red. This is because he had an extra dose of your female hormones just before he was born. The swelling will soon go away. 
In the first few weeks, you may notice that your baby's girl's vagina is also swollen and red. She might have some clear, white, or slightly bloody discharge, too. This is normal and is also caused by the female hormones she received while she was in your womb.
If the swelling doesn't go away after a few weeks, take your baby to the clinic. The staff there will give your baby a check up to make sure that all is well.

<body>Your newborn baby is getting used to being out of your womb. It is a big change! He will spend most of his time sleeping and feeding at this stage. 
Your baby may not seem to be doing much, but he is learning a lot. Although he can't see very far, he will love to look at your face. Hold him close and let him look at you. Even now he will try and copy your facial expression. Try sticking out your tongue, then wait to see if he copies you. 
Your newborn baby won't be able to stretch out his arms and legs yet. This will make him look a bit scrunched up. This is normal. His limbs will uncurl slowly as he gets used to being outside your womb.
If your baby was born bottom first, instead of head first, it may take him a little longer to stretch out. It's understandable, as his feet will have been up by his ears. It may be a few days before he's ready to straighten his legs. He will soon catch up!

<title>How long will my baby have an umbilical stump?</title>
<body>Your baby's umbilical stump will drop off about seven and ten days after he's born. 
While you were pregnant, you fed your baby through the placenta and his umbilical cord. This supply stops when he is born and the placenta is delivered.
After the birth, a midwife will clamp and cut your baby's umbilical cord. This will not hurt you or your baby. Where the cord joined his tummy, he will have a little stump. It will be about two or three centimetres long, or about the length of your little finger. A midwife will put a plastic clamp or a tie on the stump. You can take off the tie after a day or two, when the stump has dried and sealed.
The stump will then shrivel up, turn black, and drop off. This will take around seven to ten days. There will be a small wound that will heal and become your baby's belly button.

<title>How will I know if my baby's umbilical stump is infected?</title>
<body>It's normal for your baby's umbilical stump to look a bit crusty as it is healing. It might even have a little pus at the base. This does not mean that it is infected. Keeping it clean will help prevent infection.
However, the stump and the area around may be infected if it becomes swollen, red or smelly. An infected stump might also ooze lots of pus or fluid.
Talk to staff at the clinic if you are worried about how your baby's stump looks or smells.  Go to the clinic as soon as you can if your baby has a fever, is floppy, doesn't want to feed, or seems ill.
Some babies' stumps take longer to heal than others. The flesh inside the stump may look clean but unhealed and sore. If this is the case, take your baby to the clinic. They will check the stump for you. There is a simple, painless way to seal it.

<title>How do I care for my baby boy's penis?</title>
<body>Your baby's genitals are very delicate. Cleaning this area needs special care. 
You can wash your baby's penis and scrotum with just water for the first couple of weeks. After that, you can wash them with a gentle soap.
At nappy changes and bath times, wash or wipe around your baby's penis and scrotum to clean away any urine or stools. After a nappy change, you can use a damp cloth or cotton wool.
While your son is a baby, his penis cleans itself. Don't try to pull back his foreskin to clean as you won't be able slide it back.
Your baby's foreskin is attached to the head of his penis. The foreskin will separate from his penis by the time he is two years old. You don't need to help it along. Forcing back the foreskin may cause it to tear. This would hurt your baby and leave scarring.

<title>how should I care for my baby girl's vaginal area?</title>
<body>Your baby's vaginal area is delicate. You need to clean it carefully. 
You can wash your baby's vagina with just water for the first two weeks. After that, you can use a gentle soap.
When you change her nappy, moisten a soft cloth with warm water. Gently wipe the area from front to back. This means her vagina first, then her bottom. This will help to prevent germs from your baby's stools getting into her vagina.
Let her kick free in the air for a few minutes before you put her nappy back on. 
For the first two or three weeks, your baby may have a discharge from her vagina. This is normal. It is because of the female hormones you gave her in your womb. If your baby is still having discharge after six weeks, take her to the clinic. The staff there will check that all is well.

<title>How do I care for my baby boy after circumcision?</title>
<body>Circumcision is when the soft fold of skin (the foreskin) that covers the end of a boy's penis is cut off. It is a surgical practice. 
 If your baby has been circumcised, you can keep his penis clean using a mild soap or plain water as a part of his normal bathing.
After the wash, you could put Vaseline on his penis. This will protect it from rubbing against his nappy.
It's best to allow air to move around your baby's penis while it's healing. If you can, give your baby some time without his nappy on. He will enjoy kicking his legs!
Your baby's penis may take about seven to ten days to heal. At first, it may look quite red and swollen. It might have some yellow pus. These are all signs of normal healing. 
If your baby's penis gets infected, it may have redness that doesn't fade. It might bleed, and the tip could be swollen. Your baby will feel pain when he passes urine. 
If you notice any of these signs, take your baby to the clinic straight away. Clinic staff will give him the treatment he needs.

<title>When can I bathe my new baby?</title>
<body>It is best to wait at least six hours after the birth of your baby before you wash her. This is because newborn babies can get cold very easily.
 If your baby was born with some waxy coating on her skin, you may want to wash it off quickly. But this coating can help protect your baby. Leave it on for at least six hours.
After this time, you can give your baby her first bath or wash as soon as you like. For a little while you may find it easier to clean your baby without putting her in a bath or a bucket. 
Make sure you have a towel, baby clothes or a clean cloth to wrap her in, and a clean cotton wash cloth. Use warm water. Check that it is not too hot by testing it with your elbow.
Once you have bathed your baby, wrap her up quickly in a warm, clean towel. This will stop her from losing too much heat. You could hold your naked baby against your skin with a towel over her. This will keep her snug.

<title>How do I bathe my baby?</title>
<body>Get a sponge or clean cloth, mild soap, a clean towel, and a clean nappy and clothes.
Fill the bath or bucket with water. Make sure the water feels warm but not hot. 
Undress your baby down to her nappy. 
Wrap her in a clean towel. Wash your baby's eyes, ears, face and neck with a soft, wet cloth. 
Take off her nappy. If there's a stool, wash your baby's bottom first. Use mild soap on the nappy area - stools are tricky to wash off. 
Put your baby into the bucket. Slowly slip her in feet first, using one hand to support her neck and head. Hold her firmly so her head is above the water. 
Wash her scalp with water. Rinse her hair and dry it.
Wash her body with mild soap or water. 
Rinse your baby. Lift her with one hand supporting her neck and head and your other hand under her bottom.
Wrap your baby in a towel or clean cloth, then pat her dry. 
Cuddle her for ten minutes to keep her warm.

<title>Reasons why babies cry</title>
<body>All babies cry. Healthy newborns may cry for between one hour and three hours each day. 
 
Your baby can't do anything for herself and relies on you to provide her with food, warmth and comfort. Crying is your baby's way of talking to you.
 
It's sometimes hard to work out what your baby is trying to say. As a new parent, when you're unsure about what your baby needs, this crying can be upsetting. You may even worry that something is wrong.
 
Soon you will learn your baby's crying patterns and will know what she needs. Some babies cry much more than others or at certain times in the day, often in the early evening.

As your baby grows, she'll learn other ways of communicating with you. She'll get better at eye contact, making noises and smiling.

If you find your baby hard to soothe, see what she may need. For example, she could be hungry, tired or hot.

<title>Is my baby hungry?</title>
<body>Hunger is one of the most common reasons why your baby may cry. The younger your baby is, the more likely it is that she's hungry.
 Your baby's small stomach can't hold very much, so if she cries, offer her your breast. She may be hungry, even if her last feed doesn't seem very long ago. 
 Your baby may not stop crying immediately when you offer her the breast, but let her keep feeding if she wants to. If your baby starts crying again after a feed, she may still be hungry.
Some babies cry during feeds. Make sure your baby is latching on properly. Wait until your baby opens her mouth before bringing her onto the breast. This will help her get a big mouthful, and will help her to feed calmly.
If she seems to have painful wind during feeds, try to feed her in a more upright position. Burp your baby after a feed by holding her against your shoulder and rubbing her back.

<title>Why does my baby cry every time I change her nappy?</title>
<body>Your baby may cry when you change her soiled nappy because it has been bothering her.  Or your baby may cry because she finds the warm, dirty nappy comfortable. 
She may also cry because her new nappy is too tight and uncomfortable. 
A dirty nappy can easily irritate your baby's skin and make it sore. Look out for signs of nappy rash, such as red skin on your baby's bottom, thighs or genitals. Changing your baby's nappy often can help prevent this. Make sure that you dry your baby's bottom well each time.
When you change your baby's nappy, try to do it quickly. She may not like the feeling of cold air on her warm, damp skin. Also check that you don't put the nappy on too tightly. This will be uncomfortable and may make your baby cry.

<title>Is my baby too warm?</title>
<body>You can check whether your baby is too warm or too cold by feeling her tummy. Don't be guided by your baby's hands or feet, as they usually feel cool. If her tummy feels too hot, remove a blanket, and if it feels cold, add one.

Babies find it hard to control their temperature. They also can't take layers off if they get too warm. 

Take care not to overdress your baby, or she may become too hot. She will usually need to wear just one more layer of clothing than you. If it is a hot day, a vest and nappy should be enough.
 
Use sheets and light blankets as bedding. This way you can add and remove layers easily. 

 Place your baby down to sleep on her back with her feet at the end of the cot. That way she can't wriggle down and become too warm.

Sometimes, a baby may cry and feel warm because she is ill. Take your baby to the clinic if your baby has these signs. The staff there will be able to help.

<title>Is my baby tired?</title>
<body>Many babies find it hard to fall asleep, especially if they are overtired. You will soon learn the signs that show your baby is getting sleepy. Your baby may whine and cry, stare blankly or go quiet and still.

Your baby may cry more than usual when relatives come to stay, or towards the end of each day. Her crying may just be because she's had enough excitement for now. 

Take her somewhere calm and quiet. This will help her to slowly settle down and get ready for sleep.

A very young baby will be soothed by some rocking. You could also sing to her or tell her a story. This will help her to feel sleepy. Try to do this every time you put your baby to bed. It will help her to know that it is time to sleep.

<title>Is my baby ill?</title>
<body>If your baby has been fed and is comfortable, but is still crying, you may worry that she's ill or in pain.
 
Look out for changes in your baby. If she's unwell, she may cry differently. The crying may be weaker, more urgent, continuous, or high-pitched. She may be fretful and hard to soothe. 

 If your baby usually cries a lot but has become unusually quiet, it may also be a sign that she's not well.
 
Nobody knows your baby as well as you do. If you feel that there may be something wrong with her, go to the clinic. The staff there will give you peace of mind.

If your baby's crying is also followed by these signs, take her to the clinic as soon as you can. The staff will be able to find out what is wrong and can give her treatment.

<title>When will my baby smile?</title>
<body>Many babies make their first smile when they're between six and eight weeks old. But your baby may smile before or after this time. 
If you want to encourage your baby, look for times when she is calm and alert. Find a moment during the day when your baby looks at you and examines your face.
Hold your baby opposite you and talk to her, with your faces quite close together. If your baby doesn't like this, try holding her a little further away.
She may stare at you for a long time first, so keep talking to her quietly and you may be rewarded with that first grin! 
After she has mastered smiling, your baby will soon be able to laugh! 
Most babies start to laugh when they are between two and four months old. Try making silly faces and sounds, or tickling her. Have fun!

<title>When will my baby roll over?</title>
<body>Rolling over means your baby can flip from lying on his back to being on his tummy, or from his tummy to his back. 
He will probably be able to roll over when he's about six or seven months old, when his neck and arm muscles are strong enough. 
If you put your baby on his tummy at around three months, he may be able to lift his head and shoulders off the floor using his arms. This prepares him for rolling over. 
You can encourage your baby by playing with him. Put him on his tummy and wiggle a toy to one side of him. If he manages to roll towards the toy, smile and say "Well done!"
You never know when your baby will first roll over. To be safe, don't leave him alone anywhere he could fall off and hurt himself. 
If your baby is not rolling over by seven months old, talk to staff at your clinic. Don't worry too much though: babies develop skills differently, and some more quickly than others.

<title>When will my baby crawl?</title>
<body>Crawling is the next big step after sitting and is usually, but not always, a key step on the journey to walking. 
Your baby may start learning to crawl when she is between six and nine months old. This means that she will probably be crawling well by the time she's a year old. 
But not all babies crawl. You may find that your baby likes to bottom-shuffle instead of crawling on her hands and knees. Or she may like to move around on her stomach. 
Some babies never crawl at all. Instead they move straight to pulling up, standing, and walking. It's getting active that's important, not how your baby does it. 
Babies develop differently. If you're worried that your baby is slow to start crawling or moving around, talk to staff at your clinic.

<title>When will my baby get teeth?</title>
<body>Most babies get their first tooth at around six months. But babies can get their first tooth any time between three months and a year. It usually appears on the bottom, at the front. 
Your baby may be restless and might dribble for a month or two before his first tooth appears. 
Your baby's last teeth are usually in place by his second year. These are the second molars, found in the upper and lower back of his mouth. So by your baby's second birthday, he should have a full set of 20 baby teeth. 
It is best to start brushing your baby's teeth as soon as they start to come through. Use a soft  toothbrushsoft toothbrush and a bit of toothpaste. Try to clean both the surface of your baby's teeth and the gums.
Babies develop at different speeds. If your baby seems to be slow in a way that worries you, talk to staff at your clinic. They will be able to check that he is healthy.

<title>When will my baby say his first word?</title>
<body>By the time he is one year old, your baby will probably have spoken his first word! This is usually “mama" or "dada". He may know as many as five words by then, and be able to use them. You can start having proper conversations with him!
Your baby is learning to talk from his very first sound. He'll listen to you and the people around him and will start trying to copy you. He is eager to talk to you!
Make eye contact and talk to your baby as much as you can. Point to people and things as you talk about them. 
Between three and four months, he will be cry less and make more sounds.
Between five and six months, your baby will make sounds to get your attention, and will babble to himself when he plays. 
Between seven months and a year, he will try new sounds and try to copy what you are saying. He'll recognise the names of familiar objects, such as "cup".
If you're worried that he isn't saying any words by 15 months old, talk to staff at your clinic.

<title>When will my baby grasp an object?</title>
<body>Playing with objects is not just fun for your baby. It also helps her to develop her mental and physical skills. To begin with, she will be happy just to look at interesting objects, but soon she will want to grasp them.  
Your baby has a strong instinct to grasp from birth, but won't start to use this skill until she's about three months old.  Colourful objects are great at helping your baby to perfect this skill. Keep you and your baby entertained by dangling an object within her reach. Watch her try to grab it! 
Objects and toys with different textures are great for exploring. The difference between soft and hard will help excite your baby's senses. Give her safe objects made of leather, rubber and soft material to play with.
By the time your baby is about five months old, she'll start to explore by putting objects in her mouth. This is natural, and helps your baby to learn.
Choose toys or objects that are safe to put in your baby's mouth. They should be easy to clean, with no sharp edges, strings, or small pieces.  Clean them often.

<title>When will my baby sit up?</title>
<body>Your baby will be strong enough to sit between four and seven months. 
If you sit her on your lap or put her on the floor, she may be able to sit up for a moment without you holding her. 
To help your baby sit, move her legs so that they are spread out and balancing her weight. This reduces the risk of her toppling over. Once she is in this position, place a favourite toy in front of her. Place pillows or blankets around her, so that she doesn't hurt herself if she falls. Stay nearby to keep an eye on her. 
You could also encourage your baby to play lying on her tummy. Lifting her head and chest to see a toy will help to strengthen her neck muscles and develop the head control she needs for sitting up. You can help her strengthen her legs by standing her on your thighs and bouncing her up and down. This will probably make her giggle!
By the time she is eight months old she should be able to sit well without support.

<title>When will my baby be ready for solid foods?</title>
<body>Eating solids is a big step! Your baby will probably be ready to start eating solid food if she is over six months old. A baby who is ready to start solids can usually do these things:
<ul>
<li>Hold her head up.</li>
<li>Sit up well when supported. You may have to have your baby on your lap at first.</li>
<li>Make chewing motions. Your baby should be able to move food to the back of her mouth and swallow.</li>
<li>Is curious about what you are eating. When babies look at your food and reach out to it, it is a sign that they are ready to eat solid food.</li>
<li>If she is a healthy weight. Most babies are ready to eat soft solids when they have doubled their birth weight. This is usually at about six months.</li>
</ul>
Your baby may be showing these signs before six months. But it is safer if you wait until she is six months old before giving her solid food.  By then her tummy and digestive system are stronger. There is less chance of her having a tummy problem or a bad reaction to food.

<title>When will my baby stand up?</title>
<body>Most babies first pull themselves up to a standing position between eight and ten months. At first, your baby will need to hang on to you or a solid piece of furniture. By 11 months he will probably be able to stand without you holding him. Give him lots of praise and cuddles when he does this.
As your baby becomes confident, he will start to move around, still holding onto furniture. Once he can do this, he will soon be walking!
Your baby may stand up easily, but he might find it hard to sit back down again! He might cling onto you or the furniture. He may be nine or ten months old before he knows how to bend his knees and sit down.
Stay with your baby when he's moving around, so that if he does fall, you can make sure that he doesn't get hurt. It also means that when he takes his first step on his own, you won't miss it!
All babies develop differently, some more quickly than others. If you are worried about how your baby is developing, talk to staff at your clinic.

<title>When will my baby walk?</title>
<body>Most babies take their first steps around the time of their first birthday and are walking well by the time they're 14 or 15 months old. 
Don't worry if your child takes a little longer. Many children don't walk until they are 17 or 18 months old. 
When your baby takes her first steps, she will need some help. She will hold onto your hands, or she will use furniture for support. Give her lots of praise and cuddles for her efforts!
It will probably take your baby several more months to develop the confidence and balance she needs to take her first steps on her own. It will then be another few months before her walking becomes controlled and steady. 
Learning to walk is an important part of your baby growing up. It marks the change from being a baby to becoming a toddler. 
If you are at all worried about how your baby is developing, talk to staff at your clinic. The staff will be able to check that your baby is developing normally.

<title>How much will my newborn sleep?</title>
<body>Newborn babies sleep a lot! You can expect your baby to be asleep for up to 18 hours a day for the first few weeks.
However, he probably won't sleep for more than three or four hours in one go, day or night. This means that you won't be sleeping for long either.
Your baby's sleep cycles are far shorter than those of an adult, and he sleeps much more lightly. This type of sleep is a normal part of his brain development.
He'll start to sleep more deeply, and for longer, from when he is six to eight weeks old. Most babies then begin to sleep for shorter periods during the day and longer periods at night. However, they will still continue to wake up to feed during the night. 
Some babies sleep through the night when they are as young as eight weeks old. But it's more likely that your nights will be interrupted for at least the first five or six months. Try to sleep when your baby does. Take naps during the day. It will keep you energised.

<title>How can I help my baby get to sleep?</title>
<body>How you settle your baby to sleep is important. If you rock him to sleep every night for the first eight weeks, he will expect the same later on. If you leave him alone to sleep, he will get used to that, too. 
Some experts advise against rocking or breastfeeding your baby to sleep, even if your baby is less than a month old. But you should do what routine best suits you and your baby. 
When your baby is six to eight weeks old, you could start helping him to learn how to fall asleep on his own. Put him down to sleep when he's sleepy, but still awake. Stay with him if you want.
Stay quiet when you feed him at night. Keep the room dark, and don't talk to him much. Before long, he should begin to understand that night-time is for sleeping. 
You may have to accept that there will be disturbed nights. Over the first few weeks, you may find that swaddling your baby helps him to sleep. Try to sleep when your baby does, it will help you catch up on your rest.

<title>How much sleep does my three-month-old need?</title>
<body>By three or four months, most babies are sleeping 15 hours a day. Around 10 of those hours are at night. Your baby will have the rest of her sleep in daytime naps. 
Try singing her a lullaby or telling her a story before you put her to bed. This might make her settle down to sleep more quickly. If you do this often, your baby will soon understand that it is time to sleep. Doing this will also help you to bond with your baby and enjoy some quiet time together.
If your baby sleeps for more than 10 hours at night, it's fine to wake her up in the morning. This will help her to be more in tune with your routine. She might seem irritated if you wake her, but she can have a nap during the day.

<title>How much sleep does my six-month-old need?</title>
<body>By six months, your baby needs about 14 hours of sleep a day, and may sleep for as long as seven hours in one go during the night. If your baby sleeps for longer, he's probably waking up but is falling back to sleep without your help. 
Usually babies' morning and afternoon naps are between one and two hours long. If you can, have a nap when your baby is sleeping. Having a baby is tiring, so rest while you can! If you have other children to take care of, try to sit and relax while your baby naps. 
If your baby has trouble falling asleep, then it might help to give him a routine. If he goes to bed at the same time every day, he will fall asleep more easily. This is because he will expect to be put down to sleep. Why not start doing this today?

<title>How much sleep does my nine-month-old need?</title>
<body>Most nine-month-old babies sleep for 11-12 hours during the night. Your baby will also probably nap twice a day. These naps will both be about one hour long. 
If you want your baby to sleep through the night without calling for you, he will need to learn to fall asleep on his own. If he needs to be rocked or fed to sleep, he will have trouble falling asleep again without being rocked or fed. He will probably cry if he wakes up during the night. You could try leaving him for a few minutes before going to him. Or you could put something in his bed that smells of you. He might find this comforting, and be able to fall asleep.
Try not to do too much with your baby before you put him to sleep. Playing an exciting game or being in a room full of noise and people will not put your baby in the right mood. Take him to a dark, quiet place. Sing him a lullaby. This will help him relax.

<title>How much sleep does my one-year-old need?</title>
<body>Your baby still needs as much sleep as she did when she was younger. Until her second birthday, she should get between 13 and 14 hours of sleep a day. Eleven of those hours will usually be at night. The rest she will get in daytime naps.
If you want her to sleep through the night without calling for you, try to let her fall asleep by herself. If you go in and rock, feed or sing to her, she won't learn to settle herself back to sleep. This will mean more sleepless nights for you!
You can start to teach your baby to settle herself by putting her down to sleep, and then leaving her for a couple of minutes. After this time, you can go and check on her. Try not to pick her up. Slowly, start to wait a little longer before you go to your baby. This will get her used to settling herself back to sleep.
If she wakes in the night, try to settle her with as little fuss as possible. Keep the room dark, and try not to talk to her. She needs to know that night-time is for sleep.

<title>Why is my baby vomiting?</title>
<body>It is normal if your baby burps up a little bit of milk after his feed.  Perhaps put a towel over your shoulder to protect your clothes!
While bringing up milk is normal, vomiting is not. You can tell when your baby is vomiting rather than burping up milk, because there will be a lot more coming out. It can be frightening for your baby, so he's likely to cry.
Everything from travel sickness to indigestion can make your baby vomit. He may also vomit after crying or coughing for a long time.  
If a newborn baby vomits forcefully soon after eating, he may have a blockage between his stomach and intestines. He will need to go to the clinic. But this is rare.
During your baby's first few months, he may simply vomit because his tummy is too full. Hungry babies can forget how small their stomachs are! In older babies, vomiting is more likely to be caused by a virus or infection. This may also give him diarrhoea.
If you are at all worried about your baby's vomiting, ease your mind and go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to help.

<title>How can I help my baby when he is vomiting?</title>
<body>You can help your baby to stop vomiting by following these tips:
<ul>
<li>When your baby vomits, he's losing fluids. He needs to replace them.  To do this, give him sips of oral rehydration solution (ORS), a few times an hour, as well as his usual breastmilk.</li>
<li>Let him breastfeed whenever he wants. Breastmilk will help to make him strong again. It may also be the only thing your baby wants to eat.</li>
<li>Help your baby rest. Going to sleep may also help your baby's stomach to settle, so that he stops feeling sick. Try carrying him in a sling close to you. Being near you may help him to feel comforted and sleepy.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often so that you don't spread any germs if he has them.</li>
</ul>
It is best not to give your baby any medicines unless staff at your clinic have given them to you. They could make your baby worse.
Your baby will probably stop vomiting six6 to 24 hours after he starts, without any special treatment. As long as your baby seems healthy and continues to gain weight, there's usually no need to worry.

<title>Should I take my baby to the clinic when he is vomiting?</title>
<body>Usually vomiting is nothing to worry about, but take your baby to the clinic if you notice any of these signs. The staff there will be able to find out what's wrong.
<ul>
<li>He has a dry mouth, is not crying, and seems to be urinating less often</li>
<li>He has a fever and won't feed</li>
<li>He has a rash that doesn't fade when you press on it</li>
<li>He vomits for more than 12 hours, and with great force.</li>
<li>His vomit has blood or green mucus in it. The clinic will probably want to see a sample of this. If you can collect a little in a clean jar, it will help them find out what is wrong.</li>
</ul>
You should also take your baby to the clinic if he is sleepy, very irritable, and is breathless or has a swollen tummy. 
Don't worry if your baby burps a little milk after his feed. You can tell when your baby is vomiting rather than just burping milk. There will be a lot more coming out.

<title>How can I tell if my baby is constipated?</title>
<body>Constipation is when your baby has very hard, dry stools that are hard for her to pass. In your baby's first few weeks, it will take a little while for her bowels to settle into a routine. Her stools may be runny one day, and hard the next. Soon you will know what is normal for her.
The signs of constipation are easy to spot. 
If your baby cries when she passes a stool, thisat may be a sign of constipation. You may also notice that her stools are dry and hard.  She may also pass fewer stools than normal, sometimes as few as three stools a week.
Stools and wind that smell very bad are also signs of constipation. A hard, bloated tummy is another.
It may sound odd, but very liquid stools can also be a sign of constipation. Liquid stools can move around hard stools which are blocking the gut.
If you think that your baby is constipated, give her plenty of fluids. Breastmilk is ideal. If your baby has started eating solids, give her lots of fruit and vegetables. This will help to soften her stools.

<title>What causes constipation?</title>
<body>Breastfed babies are less likely to get constipation than other babies. This is because your milk is perfect for your baby. It will make his stools soft and easy to pass. 
After six months, when your baby is eating solid food, his body needs to learn how to digest new foods.  He may become constipated until he gets used to solid food. Fresh vegetables and fruits will help him to digest food and prevent constipation. 
Your baby may also be constipated if he is dehydrated. This is because his body needs lots of fluids to make soft stools.  Offer him your breast whenever he wants. If he doesn't want to feed, it could be because he's teething, has thrush, a throat infection, a cold, or an ear infection. Take him to the clinic if he refuses his feeds. The staff there will find out why.

<title>How can I help ease my baby's constipation?</title>
<body>There are many things you can do if your baby has constipation. Follow these tips:
<ul>
<li>Try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion. This helps to move hard stools along her intestine.</li><li>Breastfeed your baby whenever she wants, for as long as she wants. Breastmilk will keep her hydrated and help her digestion.</li>
<li>If your baby has started to eat solid foods, give her plenty of water or watered-down fruit juice.</li>
<li>Plenty of fruits and vegetables in an older baby's diet can help to loosen stools.</li>
</ul>
Constipation does not usually need medical treatment, and should improve after a couple of weeks. But if these home treatments don't work, your clinic may give you medicines called laxatives to help soften your baby's stools. 
Check with your clinic before you give your baby any traditional medicines. These can be dangerous for your baby.

<title>How can I prevent my baby getting constipated?</title>
<body>A breastfed baby is less likely to get constipated than a baby who isn't. Breastmilk usually makes stools that are soft and easy to pass. Keep offering your baby your breast. If she is under six months, she doesn't need anything else, not even water.
After six months, when you start your baby on eating solid food, her body needs to learn how to digest new foods.  She may become constipated until she gets used to solid food. 
To prevent constipation:
<ul>
<li>Go slowly. Start with giving her small bites of solid food before, after or in between feeds. Gradually increase the number of solid feeds.</li>
<li>Feed her fresh fruit and vegetables with every meal. They are less likely to cause constipation. Try lots of different ones - you will soon find some that your baby likes!</li>
<li>You can also still offer your baby your breast. Getting plenty of fluid will help to prevent your baby's stools from drying out.  Give her lots of clean water and diluted fruit juice to drink, too.</li>
</ul>
These will all help to prevent constipation.

<title>How can I tell if my baby has a cold?</title>
<body>Babies get a lot of colds because their bodies aren't good at fighting infections yet. 
If your baby has a cold, you may notice some of these signs:
<ul>
<li>a cough and a sore throat</li>
<li>a blocked nose and breathing trouble</li>
<li>a fever</li>
<li>slight swelling on her armpits and neck</li>
</ul>
Your baby may be irritable and restless, waking up more often in the night because her nose is blocked. She may also have trouble breathing through her nose, so feeding her could be difficult. Children can't usually blow their own noses until the age of four, so you will have to help your baby, soothe her and wipe her nose.
Your baby's cold should be gone within ten days or so, although very young babies may be ill for up to two weeks. Take your baby to the clinic if her fever continues for longer than two days. 
Your breastmilk helps to protect your baby against some colds. But some babies are more at risk than others, especially if people smoke in the house.

<title>How can I care for my baby when he has a cold?</title>
<body>Your baby's cold will go on its own. But there some things you can do to help:
Let your baby get plenty of rest and offer him extra feeds. Breastmilk helps to build his strength. If he's older than six months, offer him mashed fruits and vegetables, too.  
If his nose is blocked, breathing will be difficult. He will also find it difficult to eat and drink. 
Breathing in steam may help to unblock your baby's nose. Place a bowl of hot water under his nose, or hold a warm wet towel over his nose. Check that they aren't too hot, or you could burn him. 
Keep wiping his nose. Babies cannot blow their own noses until the age of four. 
Don't use any cough and cold medicines. They're too strong for children under six years. 
If your baby has a stuffy nose without any other signs of a cold, check that he doesn't have something stuck in his nose. 
If the cold lasts, or you're unable to clear up his blocked nose, take your baby to the clinic. Staff may prescribe some medicines suited to his age.

<title>Should I take my baby to the clinic if he has a cold?</title>
<body>Most colds are nothing to worry about. They will usually go away on their own.  
If your baby is under three months old, he is still quite fragile and needs extra care. If the cold hasn't improved after 24 hours, take your baby to the clinic for a check-up.
For a baby over three months old, you may want to take him to the clinic if his cold hasn't improved after five days.
You should also take your baby to the clinic if he:
<ul>
<li>has a fever</li>
<li>has difficulty breathing</li>
<li>keeps coughing up mucus</li>
<li>is rubbing his ears and seems irritated; this could mean he has an ear infection which is very common in babies</li>
</ul>
Babies get a lot of colds because they are not strong enough to fight them off just yet. If you are worried, take him to the clinic. It will give you peace of mind.

<title>How do I know if my baby has wind?</title>
<body>Some babies have a lot of wind after every feed. Others hardly ever have wind. 

If your baby has wind, he may:

<ul>
<li>stop suckling, and cry</li>
<li>refuse your other breast when you offer it to him</li>
<li>squirm and frown after a feed, particularly if you try to lie him down</li>
</ul>

If you spot signs of wind, you need to burp your baby. This will make him more comfortable. 

You can burp your baby by patting or rubbing his back after a feed. 

You can do this with your baby over your shoulder,shoulder; face down on your lap, or with your baby facing away from you while sitting down. Make sure you hold your baby securely while doing this. He may bring up some milk, so have a cloth ready.

Some babies find it hard to bring up wind. It may take some time. Try different positions. If your baby still hasn't burped after a few minutes, he may not need to. But if he still looks uncomfortable, keep trying.

<title>How do I burp my baby?</title>
<body>Patting or rubbing your baby's back is the best way to help her bring up wind. But she may bring up some of her feed, too. Put a cloth over your clothes to protect them.
There are three positions that are good for burping a baby. Try all of them, as you may find one works better than another.
<ul>
<li>Place your baby over your shoulder. Support her bottom with your arm. With your other hand, pat or rub her back.</li>
<li>Sit your baby on your lap with her back to your tummy. Reaching under one of her arms, support her as you gently lean her forwards, holding her chin in your open hand. Pat or rub her back with your other hand.</li>
<li>Place your baby face-down on your lap. Hold her firmly with one hand and pat or rub her back gently with the other.</li>
</ul>
If your baby hasn't burped after two or three minutes, it probably means she doesn't need to. But if she still seems uncomfortable, keep trying.

<title>How will I know when my baby is teething?</title>
<body>When your baby is between five and seven months old, his teeth start to push through his gums. 
If your baby is teething, you may notice these signs:
<ul>
<li>he has red and swollen gums and his face and cheeks are red</li>
<li>he is dribbling a lot</li>
<li>he tries to rub his gums and his ear on the same side as a tooth is growing</li>
<li>he wakes up in the night because of the pain</li>
</ul>
Some teething babies find it difficult to feed. When your baby sucks during feeding, more blood rushes to the swollen gums. The gums are very sensitive. This is why he may turn away from your breast.
Understandably, teething makes babies irritable and unsettled! Cuddle and comfort him the best you can. 
Ear infections are often mistaken for teething. If your baby seems unwell or is feverish, take him to the clinic to check what the problem is.

<title>How can I soothe my baby's gums?</title>
<body>Giving your baby something cool to bite could help ease teething pain.  Try rubbing a finger or a cold cloth over her gums.  
If your baby is more than six months old and has started solids, offer her cold water in a feeding cup. You could also give her cold mashed fruit or plain yoghurt to soothe her. Giving her hard bread or fruit and vegetables to chew on can also help. Watch her so that she doesn't bite off lumps which could choke her. 
Your baby may also dribble and get a sore chin. Gently wipe the dribble off her chin as often as you can with a soft cloth. Be careful not to rub her chin, it might be sore. You could also smooth a cream such as Vaseline on her chin. This will protect her skin. 
Sometimes your baby will not like any of these things, and a cuddle is the best way to help her.

<title>How long does teething last?</title>
<body>There is no set date when your baby's first tooth will arrive. It could be any time between five and seven months. Teething could continue for one year or more. He should have all his first teeth by the time he is two and a half years old.
Your baby may be upset for just a few days before a tooth comes through. Or he could show all the signs of teething for months before a tooth appears.
Your baby's first few teeth will probably be the worst. His next few teeth may come through more easily. Your baby may go through another tough time when he's about one year old. This is when his back teeth, called molars, come through. But by then you'll be an expert on teething!
Remember that babies develop differently, some more quickly than others. If you're worried about how your baby is developing, talk to staff at your clinic. They will be able to advise you.

<title>How can I tell if my baby has a fever?</title>
<body>It is easy to tell if your baby has a fever.
Touch her forehead if she is older than three months. If she is younger, feel her chest or back. If your baby is feverish, her skin will feel hot. Your baby may also sweat or shiver.
If she seems happy, and still wants to play and feed, then it's probably nothing to worry about. Make sure she drinks plenty of fluids. Washing her with cool water can also help to make her comfortable.
It's hard not to worry, but a fever is rarely dangerous. It's part of your baby's defence against an infection.
Take your baby to the clinic if she shows these signs as well as a fever:
<ul>
<li>she is sleepier than usual</li>
<li>she has been refusing her feeds for more than eight hours or has had less than usual in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>the soft spots in her head are sunken</li>
<li>she has an unexplained rash</li>
</ul>
Staff at the clinic will find out what is wrong. If you are at all worried about your baby, go to the clinic for peace of mind.

<title>Why might my baby have a fever?</title>
<body>Your baby has a fever because she's fighting an infection. Sometimes it's not obvious what infection is causing it. Here are some common ones: 
Common colds can cause mild fevers. They are usually nothing to worry about, and will pass in a few days.
The flu virus can also cause a fever. This is similar to a cold, but worse. 
A virus called croup can cause a fever and affect your baby's voice and breathing. 
Illnesses such as pneumonia can trigger a fever and affect her lungs and breathing, too.  
The chickenpox virus can also cause a fever and make a rash.
Ear infections are quite common in babies, and can make them feverish.
A urine infection could also make your baby develop a fever.
Sometimes even just a sore throat can cause a fever!
Babies often get fevers after they have had vaccinations. This is normal and does not harm your baby. Staff at your clinic will tell you what to look out for.

<title>How can I care for my baby when she has a fever?</title>
<body>You can treat your baby's fever at home. Here are some tips to keep your baby comfortable and help her recover quickly:
<ul>
<li>Give your baby lots of drinks. Offer her regular breastfeeds, or, if she is over six months, lots of clean water.</li>
<li>Let her breastfeed or eat when she wants to. If she does not want much, try to offer small amounts often to keep up her energy levels.</li>
<li>Let her rest if she wants to. But if she wants to be active, let her.</li>
<li>Make sure she is not wearing too many, or too few, layers of clothing. Test this by checking how warm her tummy is.</li>
</ul>
If your baby is underless than three months old and she feels very hot and seems very upset, take her to the clinic. The staff there will be able to help.

<title>How can I tell if my baby's fever is serious?</title>
<body>A fever on its own is usually not something to worry about too much.  But if your baby has a fever as well as other signs, this could be a sign of a more serious illness. Here are some signs to look out for:
<ul>
<li>Your baby is particularly sleepy or drowsy.</li>
<li>She has not wanted to feed for more than eight8 hours.</li>
<li>She's had less than half of her usual amount to drink over the past 24 hours.</li>
<li>The soft spots on your baby's head are sunken.</li>
<li>Your baby has a rash.</li>
<li>She has dry lips, dark yellow urine and seems to be urinating less than usual. These can be signs of dehydration. It means she is not getting enough to drink.</li>
</ul>
If you are worried, take your baby to the clinic. The staff there will be able to give your baby the treatment she needs to make her healthy and happy again.

<title>Your baby's stools- what's normal what's not</title>
<body>It can be hard to know what is normal for your baby. Your baby's stools can look very different depending on how old she is and what she is eating. 

The first stool your baby makes is greenish-black and sticky. Once you start breastfeeding, your baby's stool will be yellow-coloured and will smell slightly sweet.

Lots of babies strain and cry a bit when they pass stools, but it doesn't mean there's a problem. Some also only pass stools once a week. As long as they are soft and easy to pass, there's no cause for concern. 

When your baby starts solids, her stools will change again. They will get thicker, darker and smellier. 

Stools that are not normal are easy to spot.

Diarrhoea can make stools watery and runny. It can also make your baby pass lots often.

Constipation can make your baby have dry, hard stools. They may be streaked with blood.

Green stools or very pale stools are also a sign of a problem.

If you are worried about your baby's stools - go to the clinic. Staff will advise you.

<title>My baby has a rash  in her nappy area. What does this mean?</title>
<body>This is nappy rash. Nappy rash is very common in babies, particularly when they're between nine9 and 12 months old. It can happen with any type of nappy.
When a wet bottom and genitals rub against a nappy, it can make the area sore and cause nappy rash.
If your baby has nappy rash, you'll know it. Her skin will look red and inflamed. The rash will be on her genitals, the skin on her thighs, and on her bottom. Her bottom may look dry or moist, shiny or pimply.
Although it is uncomfortable for babies, nappy rash is harmless as long as it doesn't get infected.  
Some rashes can turn into a yeast infection, such as thrush. Thrush begins as tiny red spots. The tiny red spots quickly get bigger and turn into a big red rash. This can be very sore. 
You may also notice yellow patches on your baby's skin or pus-filled spots.
If you think that your baby has an infection, take her to the clinic. Staff can give her the treatment she needs.

<title>What causes nappy rash?</title>
<body>The main cause of nappy rash is wetness from contact with urine and stools in a nappy.
Your baby's skin is very soft and delicate. It can easily become irritated and sore.
Your baby is more likely to get nappy rash if you leave her in a dirty nappy for too long. But if she has very sensitive skin, she may suffer even if you change her nappies often. 
Diarrhoea can make your baby more at risk of nappy rash. That's because stools are spread over a wider area and they are very wet.
Sometimes other things can cause nappy rash. Your baby may have an allergic reaction to something that has touched her skin, such as a massage oil or lotion. She may also be allergic to a cosmetic or cleaning product, such as a type of soap or baby wipe. 
Nappy rash is very common. Do not blame yourself if your baby has it. There are easy ways to treat it at home.

<title>What is the best way to treat nappy rash?</title>
<body>You can treat your baby's nappy rash yourself. Here is how to do it:
Keep your baby clean and dry by changing her nappy often. Try to do it as soon as you can after she has passed urine or stools.
Clean your baby's bottom. You can do this using baby wipes or a mild soap. Rinse the soap off your baby's bottom with clean water. Pat her skin dry very gently.
Keep your baby out of her nappy as much as you can. The air around her bottom will help her to heal. Put her on a towel in a warm room. She will love kicking her legs without her nappy on. 
Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or Vaseline to the sore areas before you put on a clean nappy. Only use a small amount and rub it in gently. The cream protects your baby's skin from urine and stools.
A normal nappy rash should go away after three or four days of home treatment. If it does not go away, or if it gets worse, ask at your clinic for advice.

<title>How can I prevent my baby getting nappy rash?</title>
<body>The best way to stop your baby getting nappy rash is to keep her bottom dry. Here are some simple things you can do to keep her dry:
Give your baby time without a nappy. Wearing a nappy all the time can stop her skin from drying fully. Try placing her on an old, clean towel for a little while each day without her nappy on. 
Change your baby's nappy often and as soon as you can after she has passed urine or stools.  This will stop her skin from getting irritated.
Clean your baby's genitals and bottom well after she passes urine or stools. Check your baby's skin is clean and dry before putting on a new nappy.
Apply a thin layer of Vaseline or petroleum jelly to your baby's bottom after each nappy change. This will soothe her skin. It is best not to use talcum powder as this can make your baby's skin sorer. 
Try to keep nappies loose enough so that there's room for air to move round your baby's bottom. You should be able to slide your hand around the top band and leg holes. It shouldn't be too tight.

<title>What is colic?</title>
<body>All babies cry. A newborn baby can cry for about two hours a day.  But if your baby cries and nothing you can do makes him feel comfortable, he may have colic. 
Colic is a common phase in newborn babies. It starts when they are between two and four weeks old. It is usually over by the time they are three or four months old. 
If your baby has colic, you may notice: 
<ul>
<li>he has frequent bouts of intense and inconsolable crying</li>
<li>he pulls his legs up to his tummy and arches his back when crying</li>
<li>he passes wind when crying</li>
</ul>
A colicky baby usually cries in the late afternoon and evening. If it's severe, a baby can cry during the day and at night, too. Feeding your baby could take longer than usual if he is upset and restless. 
Comforting a baby with colic can be very hard. Listening to your baby crying might make you cry too! Your baby's crying won't hurt him in any way. Colic is not a serious condition, apart from the stress it creates for you and your family! If his crying makes you stressed, ask friends and family to help. Some time to yourself will help you cope.
For peace of mind, take your baby to the clinic to confirm that it is colic. They can check that the crying is not caused by another medical problem.

<title>How can I soothe my baby's colic?</title>
<body>A baby with colic can be hard to soothe as there often is no apparent cause.
Sometimes, the flavour of your milk can upset your baby. It may be something that you're eating such as onions, spicy food or beans. Try not to eat them for a while to see if it makes a difference.
Your baby may not like too much noise or activity.  Keep his room quiet and dark. If you don't feel that holding him close is helping, try putting him in his cot for a few minutes.
Carrying your baby in a sling or rocking him in your arms can also be soothing.
Some babies are soothed by certain sounds. Try humming, or take your baby near the sound of running water. 
He may calm down if he sucks on a dummy or his fingers.
You could also try massaging him gently. Use a little oil, such as sunflower or palm oil. 
Burping him after every feed may help him release any painful wind. This may also help him feel happier.

<title>Why are my baby's stools loose and watery?</title>
<body>Your baby may have diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can be caused by many different things. The most common cause is a virus called rotavirus. Nearly all children catch it by the time they are five years old. Rotavirus damages the intestines, so that food passes straight through the body. 
Food could also be the cause of your baby's diarrhoea. It may be that your baby is allergic to a food. Or your baby may have eaten something rotten. 
Diarrhoea can also be a sign of a common cold.
Even some medicines can cause diarrhoea. Clinic staff may have told you that diarrhoea is a normal side effect of some medicine they gave your baby.
Breastfed babies are less likely to get diarrhoea than babies who aren't. This is because breastmilk helps babies to fight infections and keeps them strong.

Diarrhoea is very common. It is not your fault if your baby has it. Make sure he has plenty of fluids and offer him your breast often.

<title>How can I tell if my baby has diarrhoea?</title>
<body>Your baby may have diarrhoea if:
<ul>
<li>She passes frequent smelly, watery, mucus-streaked stools.</li>
<li>She has a fever.</li>
<li>She appears to be losing weight.</li>
</ul>
Newborns tend to have a lot of bowel movements, sometimes up to five times a day in the first month. Sometimes babies pass stools after every breastfeeding session. This is because as her stomach fills up with milk, her bowels get stimulated. Breastfed babies usually have yellowish stools, and they tend to be soft. After the first month, most babies have one or two bowel movements a day.
Babies tend to have loose and watery stools at six months when they start solid food. But usually, their bowel movements settle down once they get used to their new food. 
So keep an eye on your baby's stools. If your baby passes smelly, watery and mucus-streaked stools more often, has a fever or seems to be losing weight, then your baby probably has diarrhoea. Take her to the clinic. Staff will check her and give her the right treatment.

<title>How should I care for my baby with diarrhoea?</title>
<body>Your baby needs to replace the fluids she is losing, or she'll get dehydrated. Keep offering your breast and let her feed as often as she wants.
Do not give her any fruit juice or sugary drinks. Sugar can make diarrhoea worse. If she is less than six months old, she doesn't need any water either. Breastmilk will give her all she needs.
If she is older than six months, give her small sips of water between feeds. You could also try giving her sips of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), a few times an hour.
ORS helps replace the fluids and salts your baby loses because of the diarrhoea. It comes in a packet and you mix it with cool clean water. Ask for it at the clinic.
To keep your baby comfortable, keep her dry. Be gentle when changing nappies; it's easy for a baby's bottom to become sore with diarrhoea. Use a cream such as Vaseline to protect her skin. 
Germs from diarrhoea can be passed on. Wash your hands well with soap after changing your baby's nappy or using the toilet. 
You can also help by cuddling and comforting your baby as much as you can.

<title>Should I take my baby to the clinic if he has diarrhoea?</title>
<body>Diarrhoea can be worrying if it lasts more than a few hours, but it will normally go away without treatment. 
If your child has diarrhoea for more than two days, take him to the clinic. The biggest risk of diarrhoea is fluid loss, or dehydration. Look out for these signs:
<ul>
<li>He has dry skin or lips, and the soft spot in his head is sunken.</li>
<li>He is listless and crying without making tears.</li>
<li>His hands and feet have changed colour. They might look blotchy and feel colder than usual.</li>
<li>His urine is a dark yellow colour and he is urinating less often.</li>
</ul>
You should take your baby to the clinic as soon as possible if he has these signs as well as diarrhoea: 
<ul>
<li>vomits for more than a day, or he has a fever which lasts more than a day</li>
<li>refuses to drink, has blood in his stools or has a swollen tummy</li>
</ul>
The staff at the clinic will be able to give your baby the fluids he needs and will help him to get better.

<title>How will I know if my baby has croup?</title>
<body>Croup is a common childhood virus. It makes the voice box and airway to the lungs swell up so that the baby finds it hard to breathe. The result is a bark-like cough. 
Croup usually affects children aged between six months and three years, but older children can get it, too. Your baby could get it a couple of times or more during childhood.
If your baby has croup, you'll know. The barking cough is a clear sign. Although it's frightening to hear your baby cough like this, in most cases it sounds worse than it is.
Other signs can include a runny nose and a sore throat. Your baby may also feel hot to touch and make a rasping sound when he breathes.
Croup usually starts in the middle of the night. You may find that the cold your baby went to sleep with has turned into croup. Your baby may be frightened by his coughing. Soothe him quickly - crying could make it harder for your baby to breathe. However, croup is usually harmless.

<title>How can I treat croup?</title>
<body>There are things you can do at home to help your baby. 
Encourage your baby to take extra breastmilk if she is under six months. If she has started solids, try juice and warm soup. They may taste good if she has lost her appetite.
If your baby is crying and upset, her cough could become worse. Comfort her with lots of hugs and kisses. Sit her upright on your lap, or hold her upright over your shoulder. This may help her to relax and breathe more easily.
Don't give your baby cough medicines or decongestants, as these won't help. Hot water and steam won't help either.
Your baby may have croup for as long as four to six days, peaking on the second or third night. Remember that the cough sounds much worse than it is! Croup will usually run its course and leave you both tired, but well.

<title>Will my baby need to go to hospital if she has croup?</title>
<body>Croup is a common childhood illness which is rarely serious. It can last as long as four to six days, but it usually goes away without needing medical treatment.
Very rarely, a bad bout of croup can cause serious breathing problems. Take your baby straight to the clinic if she has any of these signs:
<ul>
<li>she has a blue tinge on her lips or face, and is struggling to breathe</li>
<li>she has a drawn-in neck and ribcage</li>
<li>she suddenly seems to be very sleepy</li>
</ul>
Once in the clinic, staff will give your baby oxygen to help her breathe, and medicine to stop her airways swelling.
Sometimes, croup can lead to infections of the throat and lungs, such as pneumonia. This is very rare,  but take your baby to the clinic if her heart is beating very quickly and she feels very hot to touch.

<title>What causes heat rash and is it serious?</title>
<body>In hot and humid weather, your baby sweats to cool down. Sometimes sweat can get trapped in his skin. This causes heat rash. Babies and young children often get heat rash because their sweat glands and skin are not fully developed.
Heat rash is not serious, but it's a sign that your child is too warm. 
However, if you don't help him cool off, he could develop a more serious condition, such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
If this happens, your baby won't be able to control his body temperature. He may develop a fever, and get dehydrated. You should take him to the clinic if he stays hot to the touch or if his heat rash does not improve after four days.
Heat rash is not painful, but it can be itchy and distressing for your baby. Some of the pimples may be tender to the touch. Soothe his skin by pressing a wet cold cloth or towel against the rash. Let the air dry his skin. Try to keep him out of the sun and in the shade.

<title>How should I care for my baby if she has a heat rash?</title>
<body>Most heat rashes will clear up in a few days. But there are many things you can do to help your baby in the meantime. 
First, take her out of the sun and put her in the shade. Keep her inside the house if it is cooler.
You could also dress her in cotton clothes which are loose and cool. Heavy fabrics and dark colours trap heat and sweat. If you can, loosen or remove her clothes and give her as much nappy-free time as you can.
Keep her skin cool. Cool the rash with a cold, wet cloth, or give your baby a cool bath or wash. Let the air dry her skin as much as it can, rather than using towels. This will make your baby feel much more comfortable.
Heat rash usually goes away without a problem. But if she still feels hot to touch or the rash doesn't go after four days, it is best to go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to check that your baby is well.

<title>How do I treat bites and scratches on my baby?</title>
<body>If your baby just has a little scratch and there's no bleeding, carefully wash the area with water.If the bite or scratch is on your child's hands, or somewhere else where it could get dirty, cover it with a plaster or bandage. If it is not on his hands or feet, leave it open to the air to help it heal.
If your baby's skin is broken and there is bleeding, wipe around the wound with an antiseptic or with soap. Then, gently press the area with a clean cloth.
Once the bleeding has stopped, cover the area with a plaster or bandage. If the bleeding does not stop, take your baby to the clinic.
Check on the wound every day and clean it with water and soap. Wrap or cover it with a fresh plaster or bandage. It should soon heal.
If the wound looks infected, or has not improved after a few days, take your baby to the clinic. Staff will dress the wound and give your baby medicine if he needs it.

<title>What do I do if a bite or scratch keeps bleeding?</title>
<body>If your baby has a bite or scratch that is bleeding a lot, gently press it with a clean cloth or towel. If the bleeding hasn't stopped after a couple of minutes, or if your baby's wound looks deep, take your baby to the clinic straight away. The staff there may need to give your baby some stitches.
Your baby may lose more blood and be more at risk of an infection if she has a bite or scratch on any of these areas:
<ul>
<li>her hands or feet</li>
<li>her head, face or neck, including her ears and nose</li>
<li>her genitals</li>
<li>on any of her joints, including her shoulder, hips, knees, ankles, wrists or elbows</li>
</ul>
Try to keep her wound clean when you travel to the clinic. Take a few clean clothes and towels with you to wrap around the wound. This will protect it from dust and dirt.

<title>How can I tell if a bite or scratch has become infected?</title>
<body>It is worrying if your baby is bitten or scratched by an animal or another child. He will be very upset and will need lots of cuddles. Usually you can treat your baby at home, but sometimes scratches and bites can get infected.
If your baby's wound gets infected, it may be swollen, red and tender. There might be pus oozing from the wound, and red streaks around it.
The bite or scratch might feel hot to touch, and your baby may have a fever. 
If your baby's bite or scratch begins to look infected, take him to the clinic straight away. They will dress the wound and give your baby medicine if he needs it. Make sure you give your baby all the medicine to get rid of the infection. This will help him to recover.

<title>Should I worry about rabies if my baby is bitten by an animal?</title>
<body>Rabies is a disease that can spread from animals to humans. It spreads from an infected animal when it bites someone or licks a break in the skin. If it is not treated, it can be fatal.
Many animals in Africa have the rabies virus. The animals most likely affected are dogs, cattle, yellow mongoose and jackals. Some bats and rodents are also affected. It is always best to be wary if your baby is bitten.
If your baby is bitten or licked by an animal, take note of its behaviour. An animal with rabies may be very friendly, excitable or have trouble moving properly. They may also be drooling. If you are at all worried, go to the clinic. Tell the staff what animal bit your baby and how it was behaving. The animal may be tested for the virus. 
Rabies starts with flu-like signs; fever, headache, or tiredness. There may also be pain or itching around the area of the bite. 
Go straight to the clinic if you think your baby may have been exposed to rabies.
Staff at the clinic will give your baby a course of medicines to protect her from catching rabies. She will need all the doses to stop the virus. Make sure she gets them.

<title>How do I treat an insect bite or sting?</title>
<body>Insect bites and stings are normally harmless. But they may be painful and uncomfortable for your baby.
If your baby is stung, try to remove the sting if you can see it in your baby's skin. Scrape or flick it out with your nail. Don't squeeze it, as you may squeeze more of the venom into your baby. 
If your baby is bitten, don't pick at the bite. Simply wash it well with soap and water.
You can help to soothe swelling and itching by pressing a cold wet cloth against her skin. 
Try to stop your baby scratching. Keep her fingernails short. Scratching can hurt her skin and may cause an infection. 
If the bite or sting seems very itchy or painful, take her to the clinic. Staff may give you cream to soothe it. But if your baby's skin is broken, don't apply anything. Staff may prescribe another medicine for it.

<title>I think my baby has a tick. How do I remove it?</title>
<body>A tick is a small round insect with no wings. Ticks usually jump onto animals to feed on their blood. Sometimes they live on humans. 
If you notice a tick on your baby, try to remove it as soon as you can. 
Using tweezers or your nails, grab the tick close to your baby's skin. Gently pull straight up. Don't twist the tick, as bits can break off and stay in your baby's skin.
Wash your hands and the tick bite with soap and water.
Don't try to remove the tick by using Vaseline, alcohol, or a match, as these don't work.
If you're worried about removing the tick yourself, take your baby to the clinic. A nurse can remove it for you.
The bite should heal within three weeks. Keep checking the bite, and wash it often. If a rash or a ring forms around the tick bite and starts to spread, take your baby to the clinic. The bite may be infected. Clinic staff will be able to give your baby treatment.

<title>How will I know if my baby's bite or sting is infected?</title>
<body>Your baby's bite or sting can become infected if she scratches it too much. She might break the skin, causing dirt to get into it.
To check if a bite is infected, look to see if there is a growing area of redness around it. With a sting, look for a firm bump. 
If you think your baby's bite or sting is infected, gently wash the area with soap and water. If it is in an area that may get dirty, such as her hands, cover it with a bandage or plaster. If not, let the open air heal it.
If the infection has not improved after 24 hours, take her to the clinic. Clinic staff can give your baby the right medicine. 
Although it is very rare, babies can get serious illnesses such as meningitis from viruses carried by insects. If your baby seems confused, or gets a fever or stiff neck, take her to the clinic straight away. Staff will be able to help you.

<title>How can I prevent my baby being stung or bitten?</title>
<body>Insect bites and stings are usually harmless, and can be difficult to avoid. Your baby is bound to get some. If you are worried about your baby being bitten or stung, there are some things you can do to help prevent this.
Bees and wasps are normally out during the day. If you can, stay away from areas where there are wasps and bees. If you are eating outside, try to keep food and drink covered with clean cloths. This way, bugs will not be attracted to the food. 
Mosquitoes prefer the evenings and night. They also like to be near still or slow moving water, such as lakes, ponds and swamps.
If you are out in the countryside near lakes or swamps, or outdoors on summer evenings, apply insect repellent to your baby's skin. If it is a strong repellent, just put it on your baby's clothes instead of his skin. Do not spray it near his face.
You can further protect your baby from mosquitoes and other insects by covering his arms and legs. Light colours are better than dark. Using a mosquito net at night will also help to keep away biting insects.

<title>What do I do if my baby has an allergic reaction to a sting?</title>
<body>Most of the time, a bite or sting is harmless. Your baby will soon forget it. But some babies have a severe allergic reaction to insect stings. This is called anaphylaxis and is very dangerous. Your baby may have anaphylaxis if he has: 
<ul>
<li>a swollen face</li>
<li>vomiting and diarrhoea</li>
<li>breathing problems or a very fast heartbeat</li>
<li>faintness or dizziness</li>
<li>sweating</li>
</ul>
Take your baby to the clinic straight away if he has any of these signs after being stung. Try to lie your baby down with the stung part of his body below the level of his heart. Keep him calm, and cover him with a blanket. At the clinic, the staff will be able to check your baby and give him the treatment he needs.
Allergies to stings are rare. All babies are stung by an insect at some point, and nearly all don't come to any harm.

<title>What is meningitis?</title>
<body>Meningitis is an infection which can be very dangerous.
Your baby has a protective layer around his brain and spinal cord. When this layer is inflamed, the condition is called meningitis. 
There are two kinds of meningitis: bacterial and viral.

Bacterial meningitis is the most serious form of meningitis. It can be life-threatening and can cause deafness or brain damage. It can also lead to blood poisoning. But it is rare. 

Viral meningitis is more common. It can be relatively mild and seem a bit like the flu. You could have it without knowing it. 

You can have your baby immunised for some types of meningitis. This will give your baby the best protection from it. Ask at your clinic to find out what is available.

<title>How can my baby get meningitis?</title>
<body>Babies can get viral meningitis in the same way they can get a cold. The virus travels in the air so they could get it when someone coughs or sneezes nearby. It's also spread on dirty hands. This is why it's important to wash your hands after going to the toilet and before you touch your baby. This will help prevent germs from spreading.
A baby can only get bacterial meningitis from being in close contact with an infected person. This usually means living in the same house. A baby can catch meningitis from being kissed or touched, from sharing things such as forks or toothbrushes, or by being near someone who is coughing or sneezing.
The best thing you can do to keep your baby safe is to keep him clean. You should also keep your hands clean and not allow anyone infected to handle your baby. 
If you think that someone in your home has meningitis, encourage them to get treatment. Explain that this will keep your baby safe.

<title>How do I know if my baby has meningitis?</title>
<body>Meningitis is hard to spot. Sometimes babies don't have any signs. You won't be able to tell if your baby has meningitis for sure unless she is tested. 
The early symptoms of both types of meningitis can be very similar. This is why it's important to get medical help as soon as you notice any warning signs.
If your baby shows any of these signs, take her to the clinic straight away:
<ul>
<li>She is crying strangely, moaning, grunting and breathing quickly.</li>
<li>She is worried or irritable when touched.</li>
<li>She is vomiting and refusing food.</li>
<li>She has pale and blotchy skin or a rash that looks like small bruises.</li>
<li>She is floppy, listless, unresponsive and hard to wake up.</li>
<li>She has a fever, but has cold hands or feet.</li>
</ul>
You should also take her to the clinic if the soft spots on her head are bulging.
Always trust your instincts. You know your baby better than anyone else. If you feel that something is wrong, take her to the clinic.

<title>What is the treatment for meningitis?</title>
<body>Your baby's treatment will depend on what type of meningitis she has.
Viral meningitis cannot be treated with medicine, so your baby will just need rest and your loving care. It often clears up quickly, though your baby may continue to have headaches and feel low and tired for a while. Lots of cuddles will help her to feel better.
In very rare cases, viral meningitis can cause brain problems. If this happens, your baby may need further treatment. Staff at the clinic will tell you what your baby needs.
Bacterial meningitis needs immediate treatment. Clinic staff will give your baby medicine through a drip in her arm, and she will need extra oxygen through a mask.
Your baby will also be fed through a drip. It could take anything between a week and a month or more for your baby to get better. It depends on how ill she is.
Most babies recover from meningitis, if it is treated quickly. If you think that your baby has meningitis, go to the clinic as soon as you can. This will help keep her safe.

<title>Why are vaccinations important?</title>
<body>Getting your baby immunised is one of the best things you can do as a mother. By giving your baby all the vaccines, you will be helping to protect him and keep him healthy.
Vaccines will help prevent your baby from catching serious diseases such as TB and Polio. When someone is sick, their body makes antibodies that fight the illness. Vaccines give your baby the antibodies he needs to fight off dangerous illnesses. This will protect both you and him from suffering and distress. No mother likes seeing her baby ill. 
Vaccines are not a cure for diseases, so your baby needs to get them before he catches the disease. This is why it is important that you get them at the right time. 
Your baby will need more than one dose of some vaccines. This will give your baby added protection. If you are unsure what vaccines your baby needs and when, talk to the staff at the clinic. They will tell you when to get your baby immunised.

<title>How do I soothe my baby after a vaccination?</title>
<body>Getting your baby's vaccines is one of the best things you can do for her. They will help to keep her safe. An injection may look scary, but it is over quickly.
Afterwards, your baby may cry and be hard to soothe. This will pass. You can comfort her with cuddles and kisses. You could also distract her with a song or story.  Offering your breast will calm her, too.
You may have to stay in the clinic for a short while after the immunisation.  This is just in case your baby reacts to the injection. 
Babies react differently. You might spot a mild fever or a swelling where the injection took place. Some babies also vomit or get diarrhoea. Others just seem a little irritable. Make sure your baby rests and offer your breast often. 

If your baby gets a high fever or seems very unwell, go back to the clinic. Staff will check that all is well.

<title>My baby has a sticky eye. What does this mean?</title>
<body>Some babies get watery, sticky eyes because their tear ducts are not yet fully developed.

Tears wash over your baby's eyes all the time, keeping them moist. The tears are made in glands. Your baby has one gland above each of her eyes. Tears from her eyes are drained away through a duct which leads to her nose. Babies are often born with a duct that is not fully open, so the tears are unable to drain away. 

Your baby's watering eye should get better on its own once her tear duct has opened. You can help this along by gently massaging the side of your baby's nose, going from top to bottom. You can also remove any stickiness or crusting by bathing her eye with cooled, boiled water and a clean cloth.

While your baby's tear duct is developing, she may get conjunctivitis. This will make her eye pink, sore and itchy. Go to the clinic if you spot this.

If your baby's eye doesn't get better after a few weeks, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to advise you.

<title>My baby has a large, red lump on his eyelid. What could this be?</title>
<body>Your baby probably has a stye. This is a boil that has developed at the bottom of an eyelash. This usually happens because the eyelash root has got infected.
The first sign your baby has a stye is when a red bump appears at the edge of his eyelid. The bump will then get larger. It will burst after a few days, probably when your baby is sleeping. Your baby's stye may be uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. It will go away on its own in about a week.
If your baby's stye is causing him some discomfort, put a warm cloth over his eye. Use a clean cloth or small towel. Dip it in warm water, and then press it gently over the eye. Do this for between five and ten minutes, about four times a day. 
If the stye doesn't improve after two weeks, or if your baby keeps getting styes, take him to your clinic. Your baby may need a cream to stop the infection.

<title>My baby seems to have a lump under his eyelid. What is this?</title>
<body>If your baby's eyelid looks like there's a bump under it, he may have a chalazion. This is a painless lump that can appear under the upper or lower eyelid. It is caused by an irritated tear duct or eyelash gland. The lump can start out as small as a seed but may grow to the size of a pea or larger.
A chalazion is usually more annoying than painful for your baby. It should go away on its own after about a month. You could take your baby to your clinic if it's the first time he's had a chalazion, just to confirm that's what it is.
You can help your baby by keeping his eye clean.  Do this by bathing it twice a day for 5 to 10 minutes. Dip a clean cloth or small towel in warm water. Wring it out over your baby's eye, so that the water runs into it. Do not use soap as this will hurt his eyes.
 If your baby still has a chalazion after a month, take him to the clinic for treatment.

<title>My baby's eyelids seem swollen. What's causing this?</title>
<body>Your baby may have a bacterial infection which causes the eyelashes at the bottom of the eyelid to get inflamed and swollen. It is called blepharitis.
The infection can make your baby's eyelid look red, scaly, and irritated. He may lose some of his eyelashes, too. Your baby's eyelid may also burn or itch and he may be upset and cry a lot.
It's always hard when your baby is upset by an illness. But blepharitis is not a serious problem and it won't damage your baby's eye.
You can help your baby feel better by bathing your baby's eyelid every day with a warm compress. Dip a clean cloth or small towel in warm water. Then wring it out over your baby's eye, so that the water runs onto it. Don't use any soap - it could make his eyes sting. 
If his eye doesn't improve after about a week of regular washing, take him to your clinic. The clinic staff may give you some cream for it.

<title>My baby's stools have changed now she is having solids. Is this normal?</title>
<body>Your baby's stools will be hugely affected by what she eats. Before she started solids, her only source of food was your breastmilk. This made her stools yellow and sweet smelling. 
Now that your baby has changed what she eats, her stools will change. This is perfectly normal. 
The way your baby's stools look will depend on what you feed her. So, if you feed her some pureed carrot, the contents of her next nappy will be bright orange.
Foods that are high in fibre, such as beans or raisins, may pass straight through your baby. You may find them in her nappy. This is because her digestive system is still very young. It can't break down these foods fully yet. This will change as she gets older. 
As your baby starts to eat more and more different foods, her stools will slowly get thicker, darker and smellier. This is simply a sign that your baby is getting a wide variety of foods and is nothing to worry about.

<title>How can I tell if my baby has an ear infection?</title>
<body>Ear infections are very common in babies and young children, especially in colder weather. It can be difficult to tell if your baby has an ear infection, but there are some signs that you can look out for. 
If your baby has a cough or runny nose which turns into a fever between three and five days later, she could have an infection. It is likely to be in her ear if you spot her pulling at it. She may also be very bad tempered. This is because she is ill and uncomfortable. 
If your baby is older and quite active, she may have balance problems and be more clumsy than usual if her ear is infected.
Your baby might also have problems with sucking and swallowing. She may start to feed and then pull away from your breast or cup, because she is in pain.
Pus or bloody yellow fluid coming out of her ear is also a sign. This means she has developed a small hole in her eardrum. This should heal in about two weeks. If you think your baby's ear is infected, take her to the clinic. She may need medicine to get rid of the infection.

<title>What causes ear infections?</title>
<body>Your baby probably has a cold. This has made the middle of her ear swell up and has trapped fluid inside her ear. This makes a warm, wet place where bacteria and viruses can grow. 
When the infection starts, pus develops. Pressure on your baby's eardrum causes it to bulge and become red. Your baby may then get a fever as her body tries to fight the infection. 
If your baby plays a lot with other babies, then she will catch more colds. This means that she is more at risk of getting an ear infection.
Another reason your baby may get ear infections is because the middle of her ear is still developing. As she grows up, her ear will grow and develop. This will reduce the risk of ear infections.

<title>How can I care for my baby if she has an ear infection?</title>
<body>Most ear infections get better without medical treatment.  It should start to get better in three or four days. Usually, all your baby needs is your love and care. 
Keep offering your breast, too. This will help to keep her hydrated. If your baby has started solids, offer her some clean water. 
Also make sure that your baby gets plenty of rest. This will help her recovery.
If your baby's ear infection has not improved after four days, take her to your clinic. Your baby could have a more serious infection that is deep inside her ear. This could give her hearing problems when she is older. The clinic will give you some medicine for her. 
You should also take your baby to the clinic if she keeps getting ear infections. Lots of infections can damage her hearing, too. The clinic will be able to help.

<title>How do I treat my baby's head injury?</title>
<body>A bump to the head can be upsetting for both you and your baby. Give him lots of hugs and kisses to help soothe his crying. Hold a cool, wet cloth against the bump. This will soothe and numb the pain.
Lots of babies bump their heads, especially when they first start moving around on their own. Normally there is nothing to worry about, but some head injuries can be serious. 
You should take your baby to the clinic if:
<ul>
<li>he seems to be unusually drowsy</li>
<li>he seems weak and confused</li>
<li>he vomits repeatedly</li>
<li>his breathing is unusual or irregular</li>
</ul>
These are all signs that your baby needs fast treatment.
If you are at all worried about your baby's head injury, go to the clinic. The staff there will be able to check that all is well.

<title>What should I do if my baby gets a burn or scald?</title>
<body>Babies on the move will always get injuries. Burns and scalds are common. Baby skin is very delicate and can be hurt easily.
You can help your baby if she gets a burn or scald by following these steps: 
<ul>
<li>Cool the burn quickly by placing the area in cold water. Running water is best.  Hold it there for at least ten minutes. Don't put the whole of your baby's body in the water as she may get too cold.</li>
<li>Take off any clothing from your baby's burn before it starts to swell. If any material or clothing sticks to the burn, leave it. Trying to take it off could damage her skin even more.</li>
<li>Raise the burned part of your baby's body to help reduce swelling.</li>
<li>You should then cover the burn with a plastic bag. This will help prevent germs getting into the wound.</li>
</ul>
Babies are at high risk from the effects of burns. Once the burn has been cooled and covered, take your baby to the clinic. The clinic staff will be able to clean and treat it. They can also remove anything that is stuck in the wound.

<title>How can I keep my bathroom safe?</title>
<body>Like the kitchen, the bathroom can be a place where dangers lie hidden. But you can make it safe for your baby by following these tips: 
<ul>
<li>Remove any sharp tools or equipment from the bathroom. Keep razors and scissors on a high shelf or, even better, in a locked cupboard. This will keep them far out of your baby's reach.</li>
<li>Keep all medicines, including antacids, iron pills, cosmetics, and mouthwash safely out of reach, too. This will stop your baby from finding and eating them.</li>
<li>If you have a bath, always run the cold tap first when preparing it. This will help prevent scalds.</li>
<li>Stay with your baby when she is being washed or bathed. Don't leave her, even for a minute. If you have to leave the room, take your baby with you.</li>
</ul>
If you can, make the bathroom extra safe by putting a lock or bolt high up on the bathroom door. This will stop your baby going into the room without you knowing and could prevent accidents.

<li>Put all knives, glasses or breakable objects far out of your baby's reach. A high shelf is a good place, although a locked cupboard or drawer is even better.</li>
<li>Try to use the least toxic cleaning products available. Store them in a safe place - either a high shelf or locked cupboard. This will help prevent accidental poisoning.</li>
<li>While you are cooking, have someone watch your baby. This will stop her from coming into the cooking area without you knowing. You could also think about getting a gate or barrier to keep your baby away.</li>
<li>Place glasses, knives and hot food and drinks away from the edges of counters and tables.</li>
<li>It is best not to use tablecloths as your baby could pull on the corners.</li>
<li>Make sure that bins or large containers have lids and close them firmly.</li>
<li>Use the back rings on the cooker when possible. When you are using the front ones, turn saucepan handles towards the back.</li>

<title>How can I prevent my baby from accidentally poisoning himself?</title>
<body>The best way to prevent your child accidentally poisoning himself is to be very careful about what you leave lying around your home. Cleaning products, make-up, pills, medicines, paint and pesticides are all dangerous.
<ul>
<li>Put locks on cupboards where you keep dangerous things. Or put them in a large cabinet or box with a lock on it, and store it where your baby can't get to it. Don't put items in an unlocked cupboard or box, even if it is high up. If your baby is walking, he may be able to climb on a chair to reach things.</li>
<li>Don't leave medicines around the house or in your pocket. Your baby could easily get hold of them.</li>
<li>Keep medicines, pesticides, and cleaning products in their original containers. Never put them in containers that were once used for food and drink. Your baby may try to eat or drink them.</li>
<li>Finally, don't pretend that any sort of medicine is a sweet. He may think that any medicine he finds is safe to eat.</li>

<title>Is it normal for my baby to crawl backwards?</title>
<body>Seeing your baby crawling backwards can look a bit odd, but it is perfectly normal! When your baby starts learning to crawl, she will choose the easiest way to do it.
Your baby may feel stronger on her arms than her legs. This means she may push or shuffle backwards. Lots of babies do this. It doesn't mean that your baby is not developing well. 
Backward crawling probably won't bother your baby if she can get to where she wants to go. As her legs get stronger, she'll learn to crawl forwards. 
If you want to help your baby to move forwards, put her favourite toy in front of her, just out of reach. The struggle to get there will help to strengthen the muscles she needs to crawl forwards. 
It's normal if your baby never crawls forwards, or skips crawling altogether. As long as your baby gets more mobile, there is nothing to worry about.
Remember, if your baby was born early, she may reach this and other milestones later than other babies. Just give her time, she will soon catch up!

<title>Is it normal for my baby to breastfeed for just a few minutes at a time?</title>
<body>Yes. Your baby may prefer to snack. He may breastfeed for a minute or two, take a break, and then go back for more. Some babies do feed often and for a long time, but most don't, especially in the early months. 

If your baby is healthy, gaining weight, and seems happy after most feeds, then you know he's getting what he needs. 

To help your baby get enough milk, offer your breast often. Watch for clues that he's hungry. He'll tell you by opening and closing his mouth, making sucking noises, opening his eyes or turning his head towards you. 

If your baby falls asleep at your breast after just a few minutes, wake him up so he can have a full feed. Gently tickle his feet or blow on his face to keep him awake. 

You may also want to check how your baby latches on. He may only feed for a short while if he's struggling to get your milk. Check that he's taking in a big mouthful of breast. He should seem happy when feeding, and it should feel comfortable for you.

<title>Is it normal that my baby hiccups all the time?</title>
<body>Yes! Hiccups are common in babies under a year old. 
Your baby may get hiccups if he feeds too quickly, or if he is breathing irregularly whilst feeding. Hiccups will not bother or hurt your baby, but if he hiccups regularly or they continue for more than ten minutes, you may want to try these things: 
Hold him upright for about 20 minutes after a feed. 
Try giving your baby smaller but more frequent feeds.
Sometimes hiccups are a sign of reflux. Reflux happens when food and acid in your baby's stomach come back up. It can make your baby uncomfortable. A baby with reflux may be crying during or after feeds, and may be vomiting or bringing up milk. 
If you are worried about your baby's hiccups, or your baby is vomiting when he hiccups, take him to the clinic. The staff will check that your baby is well.

<title>Is it normal for my baby to pass stools after every feed?</title>
<body>Yes. It is perfectly normal for your baby to pass stools right after a feed. Not all babies do this, but there is nothing wrong if they do.
Passing stools after every feed is very common while you're breastfeeding. It's a sign that your baby is getting plenty of milk. As your baby's stomach fills up, the milk stimulates her gut, giving her the urge to pass stools. 
In the early weeks, your baby may pass stools during or after every feed. After a few weeks, you may find that she passes fewer stools as her gut settles into a routine. But she may still continue to pass stools after every feed. All babies are different.
As long as your baby's stools are soft and easy to pass, there's no cause for concern.

<title>Is it true that girls sleep better than boys?</title>
<body>You may be sure that your baby girl sleeps far better than your baby boy, or the other way around. But there's no research to suggest that either sex sleeps longer, or more soundly, than the other. 
One small study looked at how easily boy and girl babies could be woken from their sleep. The study showed that newborn boys were more easily awoken during the time between light sleep and deep sleep than newborn girls. 
But once they were between two months and three months old, there was no difference in how easily they were woken up, or how often.
So, nothing has been found that points to one sex sleeping better than the other.

<title>Is it true that fat babies are healthy babies?</title>
<body>This depends on how fat the baby is. It's certainly normal for babies to be chubby. If your baby is gaining weight steadily, it's a sign that she's feeding well and is healthy. 
Your baby's weight gain will probably increase once she starts solids. Her weight gain will be quickest between six months and nine months. As long as you are feeding your baby healthy meals, she will put on weight gradually.

If you are worried about your baby's weight, talk to the staff at the clinic. They will weigh your baby to check that she is well. 
If staff tell you that your baby is overweight or isn't putting on enough weight, try not to worry. The clinic will advise you on what to feed your baby and how to keep her active. You may be asked to keep a food diary. This will help the clinic work out how much food your baby needs.

<title>What is a 'club foot'?</title>
<body>A 'club foot' is a condition called talipes. It can affect one or both of a baby's feet. Usually, the front half of the foot turns inwards and downwards. 
No one knows exactly what causes talipes but it can run in families. Around 3 in 1000 births have this condition.
It can be distressing if your baby is born with a club foot, but your baby won't find it painful.  However, it will need treatment. This is so that your baby can walk well when he is older. 
Treatment usually starts at some time during the first year. The treatment depends on how severe the condition is. Gentle movements, plaster casts, splints and boots can all help. Sometimes surgery is needed. 
A new method called the Ponseti method is growing in popularity. It uses manipulation and casting methods, as well as special boots which have a metal bar inside.  If your baby has a club foot, ask if this method is practised at the clinic. If it is, your baby may not need surgery.

<title>My baby has a rash. What should I do?</title>
<body>A rash can be alarming, especially if it appears suddenly. 
Most rashes are nothing serious. Some may be caused by your baby's nappy or by the heat. If your baby seems happy and well, there is probably nothing to worry about. Keep him cool and make sure he gets plenty of fluids. Offer him your breast often.
But it is best to take your baby to the clinic if he has:
<ul>
<li>a rash and a fever</li>
<li>a rash that spreads quickly or covers a large area</li>
<li>a rash which does not fade when you press it</li>
<li>a rash and difficulty breathing</li>
<li>a rash which appears quickly after taking medicine or trying a new food</li>
<li>a rash and seems sleepy, floppy or uninterested in feeding</li>
<li>a rash which does not go after several days</li>
</ul>
If you spot any of these signs, or are at all worried about your baby, go to the clinic. The staff there will check your baby and find out what is wrong. They can give him the treatment he needs.

<title>What is chickenpox?</title>
<body>Chickenpox is a common childhood illness. It is very infectious, but usually harmless. Once your baby has had it, he probably won't get it again. 
At first, your baby will get a fever. A rash will appear later. Little red spots will soon turn into blisters. They will start on his face and spread to his body. 
Chickenpox usually doesn't need treatment. But if your baby is less than a month old, go to the clinic. He will need help to get better. If you have never had chickenpox, go to the clinic, too. You could easily catch it from your baby.
To soothe his itchy skin, try using calamine lotion. Or put bicarbonate of soda in your baby's bath. Dressing him in loose clothes will also help to keep him comfortable.
Keep his nails short, too. This will prevent scratching and scarring. You can also offer him extra feeds or extra water if he is eating solids.  This will keep him strong.
Your baby will be infectious until the spots have dried up, usually in five days. Keep him away from other children during this time.

<title>My newborn's scalp is red and covered with scaly patches. What is this?</title>
<body>This may be cradle cap. Cradle cap looks like bad dandruff. It is a red area on your newborn's scalp, covered with greasy, yellow, scaly patches. The scales will turn flaky. They will fall off, often with bits of your baby's hair. Sometimes cradle cap can appear on her face, her nappy area, armpits and nose. 
Cradle cap is common in babies younger than eight months, but older babies can get it, too. Although the condition looks ugly, it's not itchy and won't cause your baby any trouble. Some babies have it until they are two years old.
Your baby's cradle cap should go without medical treatment. 
Cradle cap is caused by pregnancy hormones being transferred to your baby. She may also have it if there's a family history of allergies, such as eczema. 

Try to wash your baby's hair often with shampoo. Then loosen the flakes using a soft brush.
You could rub olive oil into your baby's scalp. Leave it for a while, then brush off the flakes. 
Don't pick at her scalp. It could leave sore patches that could become infected. 
If your baby's cradle cap starts to look red and swollen, it could be infected. Take her to the clinic. Clinic staff may be able to give her some treatment.

<title>My baby has an itchy bumpy rash. What is this?</title>
<body>Your baby could have scabies. Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow under the skin. The bumpy rash is an allergic reaction to the eggs and stools the mites leave behind. Scabies won't harm your baby, but it can make him itchy.
Your baby can pick up scabies through contact with someone who has it. Scabies is highly contagious. Anyone can get it. 
If your baby gets scabies, he'll get a very itchy rash. It will appear as scattered red bumps, usually between his fingers, around his wrists, on the outside of his elbows, and in his armpits, or on his belly and genitals. It may also show up on his scalp, face, kneecaps, hands and feet. 
The itching may be worst for your baby after a wash or at night. Nasty-looking scabs may form over the areas your baby has scratched. 
If you think your baby has scabies, take him to the clinic. Clinic staff will give you a cream to treat it. Apply it over your baby's whole body. You will need to leave the cream on for several hours. You and your family will also need treatment.

<title>My baby's cheeks are suddenly bright red. Why is this?</title>
<body>Your baby could have slapped cheek disease. It is caused by a virus that spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It usually starts with a fever. He may also have flu symptoms, such as a sore throat. Over a week, your baby's cheeks will turn red as if they've been slapped. The red rash might spread to the rest of his body.
The disease will go away on its own. But you may want to take your baby to the clinic to check that it's slapped cheek disease. Also go if his fever lasts for a few days, he may have a different infection.
The rash may make your baby uncomfortable.  Make sure he gets plenty of rest and offer him extra breastfeeds. If your baby is eating solids, he can have water, too.  Keep feeding him well. This will keep him strong.
Most mothers don't catch slapped cheek disease. If you do, you might get painful joints and a rash. It will go away without treatment.
The rash can sometimes reappear months later when your baby gets hot. It doesn't mean the infection has come back.

<title>How is scabies treated?</title>
<body>If your baby has scabies, the clinic will give you a cream to treat it. You and the rest of your family will also need this treatment. Scabies can easily spread.
Put the cream on at bedtime and wash it off first thing in the morning. If your baby sucks on his hands or fingers while he sleeps, cover his hands overnight with socks to prevent him swallowing the cream. 
If the itching doesn't start to get better after two weeks, or if it gets worse, go back to the clinic. You may need to repeat the treatment or get a different cream. 
Your baby may be itchy for up to three weeks. The clinic may give you some cream to soothe this. Keep your baby's fingernails short to prevent him from scratching. 
You'll also need to remove the mites from the house once your baby starts treatment. Clean the floors and wash your baby's clothing, towels, and bedding in boiling water. 
Seal anything that can't be washed in a plastic bag for a week. Scabies mites can't survive long without a human host.

<title>How can i prevent my child catching malaria?</title>
<body>The best way to protect your baby from malaria is to keep mosquitoes away.
Malaria is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. The mosquitoes that carry malaria usually bite at night, particularly during the rainy season. They are most likely to be near still water, such as swamps and lakes. 
There are many ways to protect your baby from mosquito bites.  You could dress your baby is light coloured clothing with long sleeves. Dark colours attract mosquitoes. 
Try to keep your baby in the shade or a cooler area, too. Mosquitoes don't like the cold.
Use a mosquito repellant. You could spray it on your baby's clothes or close to her bed. Do not put strong repellants on her skin, and make sure she doesn't breathe any in.
You could also buy a mosquito net to hang over your baby's bed, or to pin over entrances or openings to your home. Insecticide-treated nets are the best.

<title>How can I tell if my baby has malaria?</title>
<body>If your child is bitten by a mosquito, there is a risk of her catching malaria. She may have malaria if:
<ul>
<li>she has a fever, but is shivering</li>
<li>she is irritable and very sleepy, but not sleeping well</li>
<li>she is vomiting, doesn't want to feed and is breathing quickly</li>
<li>she feels very cold to touch</li>
</ul>
Symptoms start showing about ten days to four weeks after being bitten. 
If your baby has these signs, take her to the clinic as soon as you can. Only a blood test will confirm if it is malaria. The clinic will give your baby the right medicine. 
If malaria is diagnosed, your baby will need plenty of rest and healthy food. She will also need to be washed often with cool water, to lower her fever.

<title>1-week-old</title>
<body>Your newborn is getting used to this big, noisy world! You may notice he moves in a jerky way as he adjusts. Soon, his movements will become smoother.
You are probably still learning how to breastfeed. It will get easier, so be patient with yourself. 
You may be worried that your baby isn't getting enough milk. If your baby is feeding every two to three hours, or at least eight times a day, he's probably getting enough. The colour of your baby's stools is a good way of checking. They will be black at first and will become yellow-coloured by day four.
Take care of your baby's umbilical stump. Keep it clean and dry. Wash it gently with antiseptic, and then pat it dry with a towel.  Let the stump stick out of the top of your baby's nappy, so that it stays clean dry. It will come off naturally in a few days. You don't need to pull on it.
Remember to visit the clinic for a check-up this week. Staff will make sure all is well.

<title>2-weeks-old </title>
<body> At two weeks, your baby is busy sucking, grasping, blinking and rooting for your nipple. Sometimes she'll catch your eye and look at you. Grab the chance to respond by looking back intently, smiling and nodding.  She's learning fast!
If your baby doesn't stop crying and seems unsettled, she may have colic. Colic is very common in newborns but they grow out of it. 
Skin-to-skin contact is important for your baby. Your baby loves to be touched and held. Holding your naked baby next to your skin (with a cover over the two of you) will help to keep her at the right temperature. 
Your post-birth bleeding will be less heavy now. If it becomes heavy and bright red again, then you are probably being too active. Try to rest. If you are soaking more than one large cloth an hour, go to the clinic for help. 
Try to eat healthily. Have lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. It's best not to eat fatty or fried foods. Healthy food will give you more energy. Try not to drink alcohol. Alcohol enters your breastmilk, so when you drink, your baby drinks.

<title>3-weeks-old </title>
<body> Look out for your baby trying to lift his head when he's lying on his tummy. He may even be able to turn his head from side to side. 
It is normal for mothers of newborns to feel very tired. Try to sleep whenever your baby does. Have lots of naps during the day. Try to eat healthy food, as it will give you energy. If you have other children, perhaps ask a friend or family member to help you.
You may be more tired if you don't have enough iron. Eat plenty of lean meat and pulses, such as chickpeas and beans. 
Cracked nipples and sore breasts are common problems while breastfeeding.  It may just be that your baby isn't latching on properly. Breastfeeding should be a pain-free experience. Ask clinic staff to show you how to help your baby latch on.

<title>4-weeks-old </title>
<body> Your baby is starting to lose her newborn quiver and jumpiness. She's getting stronger every day and learning about the world around her. She might look at you and hold your gaze.

One exciting change is that she's beginning to make noises. She can coo, gurgle, grunt and hum. This is her way of talking to you! Try to coo and gurgle back. Keep talking even when you put her down and move away.

Are you still feeling sore when you sit down? It may be difficult, but try to do pelvic-floor exercises. They speed up healing and help to prevent your bladder leaking.

Having a baby is a big change. Some mothers feel stressed and sad. If you have trouble sleeping and can't stop worrying, you may have postnatal depression. Go to your clinic for help, or ask for help from a friend. You don't have to cope on your own.

Your baby’s memory is getting better all the time. While she may forget the toy, she's been able to recognise your voice since she was in your womb.

Washing your baby can be fun for you both. Gather a sponge and a clean towel and fill a bath or bucket with water. Make sure the water feels warm but not hot.

Wash your baby’s eyes, ears, face and neck with a soft cloth and water. Then take off her nappy. If her bottom is dirty, clean her first. To put your baby in the bath or bucket, slowly slip her in feet first, using one hand to support her head. Move her around gently and sing to her. Most babies will relax and enjoy the water. It may even remind her of being inside you.

After you have washed her, gently pat her dry. Never leave her alone when she is in water.

<body>By now, your baby can recognise your face. She will probably prefer you and your partner to other people. She may coo and kick with pleasure when she sees you. You could see her first smile soon. 
Your baby's also noticing her surroundings. Noises will start to interest her, and she will like colourful patterns. 
You'll have another postnatal check at your clinic soon. Clinic staff will want to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. Make sure to tell them about any worries that you have. 
During the check-up, your baby will be vaccinated. This is to protect her against diseases such as TB and Polio. The injection may upset your baby, but it is the best way of protecting her. Give her a cuddle and feed afterwards to comfort her.
Perhaps you're ready to have sex again. Or maybe it's too soon for you, but your partner wants to. If you're not ready, try to be intimate in other ways. Talk to your partner about how you feel.

<title>7-weeks-old </title>
<body>This week, your baby may be able to lift his head and chest when he is lying on his tummy. Learning to control his head is an important milestone for him.
Your baby is also listening to you more each day. When you speak, he may stop what he is doing to listen to you. Keep talking to him, repeating his coos and noises. Describe what you're doing as you move around. Speaking to your baby will comfort him and encourage him to talk to you.  
It will be useful for you to learn how to express your breastmilk. This will allow someone else to feed your baby when you're not with him. Gently massage your breasts behind the nipple to stimulate the milk. Then slowly squeeze milk out of your breasts into a very clean bowl. Express each breast twice and store the milk somewhere cool.
Try not to feel guilty about leaving your baby. Time apart will give both of you a chance to socialise. Give your baby lots of cuddles when you get home.

<body>Your baby is much stronger. She may now be able to hold up her head for a few seconds. 
Your baby's eyes are also better at focusing. You might see her looking at her own hands. She is starting to understand that it's her hand and she can use it. Soon she will reach out to grasp things. Her three dimensional vision is beginning to develop now.  She is also a better listener, and understands where sounds come from.
It is normal to feel very tired when you are a parent. Try to sleep when your baby sleeps. If you have another child, consider asking a friend to take care of them while you get some rest. 
Eating healthy foods will give you more energy. Try to eat lots of fruits, vegetables and lean meats. Drink plenty of water and fruit juice, too.
You may be worried that your baby isn't getting enough milk. If she is feeding more than six times a day, has wet nappies and has yellow stools, then she is probably getting enough. If you're worried, go to the clinic. The staff there can check that your baby is healthy.

<body>If your baby is sleeping five or six hours without waking, you are very lucky! Most babies at this age will still wake up during the night. You'll probably notice that your baby stays awake longer in the daytime, though, and has definite times when he wants to play. He is beginning to know night from day. 
Some minor illnesses are common in babies and won't need medical treatment. But if your baby has a fever, a cough, doesn't want to feed, has difficulty breathing or has diarrhoea, you should take him to the clinic. You will probably find that your baby is healthy, but it is best to make sure. If he is ill, he can get the right treatment at the clinic.
Many women with young babies feel unhappy. If you feel unable to cope, go to your clinic. You may have postnatal depression. Clinic staff will be able to help.

<body>Your baby is moving more smoothly now: she will love stretching her arms and legs.
Give your baby enough space to stretch. Lay a blanket on the floor and let her move around on it. This helps to strengthen her developing muscles. If she's lying on her tummy, she'll probably start to push off with her legs. She's on her way to being mobile! 
It is rare to get pregnant while you are breastfeeding. However, it is best to use contraception if you have sex. Waiting a couple of years before having another baby will give your body time to recover from pregnancy and labour. Raising children with a two year age gap will also make life easier for you. You can get more information on contraception at the clinic.
Your baby will need her next batch of vaccines next week. Remember to go to the clinic.

<body>You may think your baby is too young to sing or talk to, but it will be worthwhile if you do. Hearing you sing or talk to him will eventually help him learn to talk.
If he looks the other way or loses interest while you're singing or talking to him, just try something else or give him time to rest. 
Sometimes friends and family members will give you lots of advice about your baby. Even though they are trying to help, it can be annoying! Trust your instincts and do what you think is best. You know your baby better than anyone else.
It is best not to use traditional medicines or healers for your baby, even if your family has recommended them. Traditional medicines can be harmful to your baby. If you want to use something, ask at the clinic if it is safe first.

<body>By three months, your baby is getting more flexible. She might enjoy opening and closing her fingers, or clapping her hands. 
Your baby's sense of humour is developing, too. A tickle or a kiss on her tummy is likely to produce a chuckle. 
Your baby may enjoy playing outside. Make sure she plays in the shade, so that she doesn't get too hot. Put her on a rug or blanket, so that she doesn't get dirt on her body or in her eyes.  
Your baby may have diarrhoea if she is passing very liquid stools straight after a feed. Give her plenty of breastfeeds. She doesn't need any water. If the diarrhoea continues for more than a couple of days, take her to the clinic. The staff there will be able to help.

<body>Right from birth, your baby has loved to be touched. It's important for her growth and development. Holding your baby against your skin helps you to bond. 
Different textures will start to interest your baby. Let her touch different things, such as towels, wool and leather.  She may try to mouth the fabric, so choose carefully. Don't leave her alone with anything that could come apart in her mouth. 
It is easy to forget to take care of yourself when you have a baby. But you need to be healthy and well rested. Try to eat breakfast every day. Have lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Also try to eat lean meats and pulses, such as beans and lentils.
Breastfeeding can make you thirsty. Drink plenty of water. You should also try not to drink alcohol. Alcohol can enter your milk and reach your baby.
It's easy to soothe a baby with a cold. Offer her extra feeds and wipe her nose often. Plenty of cuddles and rest will also help.

<body>Your baby's starting to make sense of the world. As his brain develops, he is getting more curious. He may play with a small toy that he can hold and shake about. He will be learning about colour, shape and size, too. He also learns from the noise a toy makes and from feeling if it is soft or hard. Just playing helps your baby's brain grow.
Your baby is more at risk of getting ill than you are. Try to wash your hands often, to prevent passing on germs. This will help to keep him healthy. If you can, ask other people to wash their hands before they handle him.
If your baby has a bite or a scratch, wash it well with soap and water. If it is on his face, hands or feet, put on a plaster or bandage. This will prevent it getting infected. Otherwise, leave the area to heal in the open air. If the bite or scratch seems infected, take your baby to the clinic.
Remember to take your baby to the clinic for his vaccinations this week. They will help keep him safe.

<body>Encourage your baby to strengthen her muscles by placing her on her tummy. She may lift up her head and shoulders, using her arms for support.  
Your baby may even be able to roll over from her front to her back. Encourage your baby by jiggling a toy on the side she usually rolls to. Clap and smile when she does! 
Try to help your partner to bond with the baby. It will help him feel more involved and will give you some time off. You could suggest that he spends bath time with the baby, or that he sings to her. Dads can be very good at entertaining babies. He could pull silly faces or bounce her up and down. 
If you are returning to work, you may have to start expressing your breastmilk. This means that someone else can feed your baby if you're not with her. Massage your breasts behind the nipple and then slowly squeeze milk out into a very clean bowl. Express each breast twice. Store the milk somewhere cool.

<body>Your baby is changing quickly. She can make basic sounds. She may even say ma-ma this month! Don't worry if your baby doesn't. All babies develop differently. 
Some mothers think that their babies should start eating solids at four months. But your baby still needs your breastmilk only. It is very important to wait until she is six months.  If friends and family members tell you it is time to start solids, explain to them that it is best to wait. 
If your baby feels very hot and seems unsettled, she may have a fever. Offer her extra feeds. Keep her cool by washing her with cool water. If her fever does not improve after a couple of days, take her to the clinic. Staff there will be able to find out what's wrong and give your baby the right treatment.

<body>You may notice periods of quiet now. Your baby, who so far has needed your full-time attention, may be happy amusing herself. You may find her absorbed in playing with her hands and feet!
It's normal to feel anxious and guilty when leaving your baby with a friend or relative. It's natural to want your baby with you at all times, but it may do you good to take a break. 
Your baby will benefit from being with loved ones or trusted friends. As she grows, your baby will need to learn how to interact with others. You can give her lots of cuddles when you get back!
If your baby is vomiting, offer her extra feeds. Carrying her in a sling may also comfort her. Vomiting a little bit is normal and usually harmless. However, if she is vomiting a lot or has a fever, take her to the clinic. The staff there can find out what is wrong.

<body>Even though crying is still your baby's best form of communication, he's also getting a sense of humour. Play peek-a-boo with him. See if he laughs when your face appears from under a blanket. 
Encourage your baby's giggles and smiles with funny faces and lots of silliness. He'll enjoy hearing lots of sounds. Click your tongue, whistle or make animal noises. He'll love it.
It's hard to do all the chores when you're giving so much of your time to your baby. If you have too many things to do, just try to finish the most necessary tasks. Organising your home so that you know where everything is will also make your life easier.
Sometimes, feeling very stressed about chores can be a sign that things might be getting too much for you. If you feel that the clutter and chaos are out of your control, talk to someone. Staff at the clinic or a close friend can give you the support you need.

<body>Following a night-time routine may help settle your baby to sleep. Feed her, give her a bath, sing songs, then put her to bed. Having a routine will give you and your baby time to relax. To give you and your partner a regular break, perhaps take turns putting your baby to bed each night. 
After getting used to life with your new baby, you may find it hard to remember what life was like before your baby. You may realise there are things that you miss. 
Spend some time by yourself. Make sure you take a proper break at least once a week. Ideally, also try to find half an hour just for you each day, maybe at nap time.
Have an adult conversation. Whether over the phone or in person, chatting with a friend, relative or your partner can re-energise you.

<body>Your baby can't show his emotions in the same way that you can. But he can certainly let you know when he's angry, bored or happy. Your baby may give you hugs and kisses, but he's more likely to show his love for you by raising his arms when he wants to be picked up. He may also cry when you leave the room. 
Finding the time and energy for a sex life when you're new parents is hard. But with a little planning, it is still possible to rekindle the romance in your relationship. Try flirting with your partner. This will put you both in the mood. You can also try doing things together as a couple at home. Why not suggest a massage?
Your baby is likely to catch minor illnesses in his first year. This is a normal part of growing up. But it can be worrying for you when your baby has an upset tummy, rash or fever. Trust your instincts. If the symptoms last or you feel that something is wrong, go to the clinic.

<title>5-month-old, second week </title>
<body> By now, all your baby's kicking, rolling and waving is paying off. She's getting much stronger. Sit her on the floor and you may find she's able to sit up for a while on her own.  Once she's sitting, spread her legs apart. This helps her to balance. Surround her with pillows and stay close in case she falls over. 
By now, it's likely that you and your baby are so close, she cries if anybody else comes near her. When your baby rejects others, it's hard on them and means more work for you. Try to involve your family in playing, changing nappies and bedtime. 
With your baby nearly six months old, you may be thinking about stopping breastfeeding. But you will still be making all the food your baby needs. There's no need to stop. Your baby will soon need extra goodness in the form of solids, but your milk will still be her main food for a while longer.

<body>Your baby's sight is developing. He can now see small objects and track moving things. Try hiding his favourite toy with just a corner of it showing. He'll have fun finding it! You can use his improving eye sight to play hide-and-seek games.
Your baby may now be able to copy you, another source of fun. Stick out your tongue, puff out your cheeks and see if he copies you.
It can be hard to choose someone to look after your baby when you're not there. You need to feel sure that your baby will be safe and happy. Find someone that you trust, then spend some time with them and your baby. You will soon find out if they are happy together.
Your baby may enjoy playing outside on a warm day, so you need to know how to keep him safe in the sun. Keep him somewhere shady and cool during the middle of the day. Dress him in long, light clothing. This will protect his skin and keep him cool. It is a good idea to use some sunscreen to protect him from burns.

<body>Your baby now sees and hears the world almost as well as you do. Her communication skills are developing fast, too. Her sounds show her feelings. She may be happy, eager, or satisfied that she's solved a problem.
She may start to babble, repeating sounds such as "ba", "ma", "ga". It's all progress towards when she starts talking.
If you lack sleep, it can be hard to function during the day. If possible, try taking a short nap. This will give you a little boost. You could also try to share out chores among your family. Explain to them why you need their help.
To help you relax, let your partner settle your baby for the evening. Drinking some warm milk and taking deep breaths will also help you to unwind. Darken the room and keep it quiet.
Try to take care of yourself, too. Eat healthily, try not to drink much coffee or cola, and exercise often. Get the most difficult or tiring work done early in the day, and gradually relax as the day goes on.

<ul>
<li>vegetables such as sweet potato or yam</li>
<li>beans</li>
<li>fruit, such as banana or mango</li>
<li>baby rice, sago, maize, cornmeal, millet, pap or mielie. You can mix these with some of your breastmilk.</li>
</ul>
 Make sure all fruits, vegetables and beans are mashed well. 
You need to make sure you're getting the right food, too. Eat breakfast every day, your body needs it! Protein such as eggs or carbohydrates like porridge will give you energy to last all morning.
Eating fruits and vegetables will also keep you healthy. Try to have some every day.
If you need an energy boost, nuts, dried fruit and cereal are all good options. Drink lots of water, too. It will keep you feeling refreshed.

<body>This could be the month your baby gets his first tooth.  One of the bottom front teeth usually appears first. Gently clean them twice a day with a toothbrush or a clean finger. You could turn it into a game to make it more enjoyable for your baby. 
Your baby may use one hand more than the other. Then he may switch to the other. But you won't really know whether he is right or left-handed until he's two or three years old.
Don't try to change which hand your baby uses. Forcing him to use a certain hand can confuse him. It can also lead to problems with coordination.
Do you compare your baby with others? Most mothers do. When you hear about a baby who seems more advanced, it's natural to wonder, or even worry, if your own baby is alright.
Every baby grows and develops at his own pace. Your baby may be slower because he's focusing on a certain skill. 
But trust your instincts, too. If you're still worried, talk to staff at the clinic.

<body>Your baby is probably getting more active now. Comfortable clothes will help her to move around. Pick soft, loose, stretchy fabrics that won't rub her skin. Don't use clothes with rough or scratchy seams, long ties, buttons or bows, which could get caught as she crawls around. 
Like most new mothers, you probably don't think about yourself very often. Looking after your baby, working, being a partner, and doing chores all tend to come first. But you are important, too! If you don't take care of yourself, everything else gets harder. 
Sharing chores and childcare with your partner or family can take the pressure off you. If you can, have one regular activity that's just for you, such as a walk or a chat with friends. 
Has your baby started playing with other babies yet? She'll benefit from the change in environment and early lessons in socialising. But she may also pick up more infections. 
In the long term, this may be a good thing. Each time your baby gets an infection, it can help to build up her immunity and make her stronger.

<body>Does your baby like a certain object or toy? If so, he soon won't be able to go anywhere without it. This is a sign of your baby's growing independence, as he can use a toy or cloth for reassurance instead of you. 
Family members may still be giving you lots of advice. Remember that they mean well. Try not to react if they criticise your parenting. Have confidence in your skills as a parent - you have been doing well so far!
Some babies suffer from dry, itchy skin. Oils such as coconut, palm and olive oil are gentle moisturisers. Why not try giving your baby a massage after his bath? Rubbing the oil gently into his skin can soothe and relax him. If your baby has itchy skin, particularly on the back of his knees, he may have eczema. Go to the clinic if you are worried about it. Staff there will give you to some cream to help ease the sore skin.

<title>7-month-old, first week </title>
<body>Your baby is probably keen to feed herself now.  Perhaps she grabs the spoon you're feeding her with, or takes food from your plate. Try scattering finger foods such as banana chunks or broccoli onto her plate. She will love picking them up and eating them!
Your baby may have a good appetite, but not many teeth. Start with food that she can gum or easily move round her mouth. As she grows, you'll be able to give her bite-sized pieces of whatever you're eating.
The sight of your baby's first tooth may have been exciting, but it may make you nervous about breastfeeding. If your baby bites your nipple, take her straight off the breast. This way she will learn that biting means she has to stop feeding. Or bring her in close to your breast so her nose is covered with breast tissue. She will have to let go of the breast to breathe!

<body>You've probably told your baby not to throw toys or pull his sister's hair. This is the age when your baby may begin testing boundaries. Your baby is just being curious, rather than naughty. 
Telling your baby he is doing something wrong won't mean much to him at this age. He won't be able to remember things for very long. The best tactic is to distract him from what he's doing.  
Your baby loves to put things in his mouth. It's a good way for him to find out about the world. Keep small items that he could choke on out of his reach.

<title>7-month-old, third week </title>
<body>Don't worry if your baby has gaps between her teeth. Milk teeth often grow through the gums at odd angles. The spaces between your baby's teeth will probably close up by the time she's three, once all of her baby teeth have grown. 
Around now, your baby may get nervous about you going away. She's become so attached to you that leaving her for even a minute could make her cry. 
Your baby's anxiety is normal, but there are good reasons why you should get away occasionally. Short separations will help your baby to socialise with other people. She'll soon learn that you always come back to her.
You don't have to go out for long. As long as your baby is awake and aware that you're away, she'll start to get used to the idea. It will help you to adjust, too!

<body>By now your baby's emotions are becoming more obvious. He may blow a kiss to familiar people, and even do it again if you praise him for it. He is also beginning to notice other people's moods and copy them. If he sees someone crying, he may start crying, too. 
Taking care of a baby can be hard, especially if you have work to do. But by now, you and your baby may be developing a daily routine. Being able to plan ahead can make life much easier. If you know you can get a few things done before your baby wakes, and you also know when he is likely to have his nap, you can plan your day. 
Prepare the evening meal earlier in the day, so you are not trying to prepare vegetables and deal with a tired baby who wants to go to bed. Prepare everything you need for nappy changing and bathing, so it's all ready when you need it. 
You could involve your baby in your daily chores, too. Save time and have fun by bathing or washing with your baby. Or make a game of household chores. Your baby will love to watch you as you tidy his room.

<body>Now that your baby is mobile, she will start to have bumps and falls. These are a part of growing up. Enjoy watching her explore and discover her limits.
Let her learn for herself, but make your home safe. 
Try crawling on the floor yourself. This will help you to spot any dangers. Put breakable or sharp objects out of your baby's reach. Also check that there isn't anything on the edge of tables that your baby could knock off. 
Many new mothers and fathers say that once the novelty of life with a baby wears off, they start to drift apart. Having a baby is a life-changing event. It is easy to become distant.
Let your partner know that you miss time together. Your partner probably feels the same. Think of things to do together, such as going for a walk. This will help you to feel closer.

<body>Your baby is now exploring objects by shaking, banging, dropping, and throwing them. He's getting the idea that you can do things to an object.  
Your baby will start to show interest in things that you use. Slowly, he will start to use objects properly. You may find him trying to brush his hair or drink from a cup.
It's normal for your baby to start getting upset when you leave him in the care of others. In fact, it's healthy, but this may not make it any easier to do.
Say goodbye in a gentle but firm way. Tell him that you'll be back. Try not to show that you are upset. If he seems frightened, or bursts into tears, calm him before you go. 
Stay away from him once you have said goodbye. Don't turn to look back, as it will only make things harder for you both.

<body>Your baby's vision is much clearer now. She can almost see as well as you.  She can now recognise people and objects across a room. She may see a toy on the other side of the room and try to crawl towards it. Her eyes are probably close to their final colour, too, though you may see small changes later.
Once your baby is moving around, keeping up with her can be tiring. Remember to take a break when you're feeling frustrated. 
When you feel as though you can't cope, try asking someone to watch your baby for you. Perhaps your partner could watch her for a while. You could also try taking a few deep breaths or counting to ten to help you calm down. Perhaps visit a friend with a baby so you can share the joys and problems over a cup of tea. 
Try taking a nap when your baby sleeps. Not getting enough sleep can make it harder to stay calm. Ask for help on a regular basis. This will stop you from feeling really overwhelmed.

<body>Your baby may have started standing and moving around the room by holding onto furniture. If the floor is clean, going barefoot will help him to balance. But if he is playing outside, a pair of thick, loose socks will help protect his feet from scratches and from picking up worms. 
Now that your baby is starting to be a little more independent, you may want to start trying for a little brother or sister for him. 
It is best to wait until your baby is two years old before trying to get pregnant again. Waiting two years has lots of advantages. It will give you time to enjoy the baby you have and will also give you time to save money. 
Waiting also gives your body plenty of time to recover. Pregnancy and birth is hard on the body. Your body needs time to get back to the way it was before you were pregnant. Having another baby too soon could make you more likely to have an early birth or a small baby.

<title>9-month-old, first week </title>
<body>It can be hard to travel with your nine-month-old. She's become used to her surroundings and she likes familiar things. She'll probably be clingy and need distracting. Take her own blanket or favourite toy, so she has a little bit of home with her.  Quiet time away from noise and strangers will also help her to adjust.
Snacking can be as good for busy parents as it is for growing babies. Here are some ideas for keeping snacks healthy:
Fresh or dried fruit makes a great snack and is easy to take with you. Fortified cereal and raw vegetables are good, too. Your baby can also snack on these finger foods and will enjoy feeding herself.
When you're getting ready to go out, take a few healthy snacks for yourself. It will help you to stay energised and you won't have to buy something while you're out. 
Make sure you drink plenty of water. This will keep you refreshed. You could flavour it by adding some fruit juice.

<body>By this week, your baby should be able to remember specific information, such as where his toys are kept. He'll also be able to copy actions he's seen as far back as two weeks ago. But he still won't remember most of his experiences. Your baby's long-lasting memory probably won't develop until he's two or three years old.
When it comes to raising children, there are lots of parenting styles and methods. It can sometimes be hard to not say anything when you see a parent doing something you wouldn't.
Remember, what works for you may not work for them. Think about how you feel when you are given advice.  Most of the time, there is no right answer. Every parent copes in a different way.
Bear this in mind if you feel someone is doing something that may harm her baby. She may not be aware of the risks. Be honest about your concern. 
Your baby's measles vaccine is due soon. Check with staff at the clinic to find out when it is.

<body>Your baby's babbling is probably starting to sound more like real words. Your baby thinks she's saying something, so respond as if she really is!
Your baby still understands more from your tone than from your actual words. She knows when she's pleased you, so offer lots of praise. 
Talk to your baby while preparing dinner and doing housework. The more you talk with her, the more she'll learn. Try to look at your baby while you talk to her, so she can see your facial expressions and respond to them.
If your baby has come out in spots and you don't know if its heat rash or something more serious, read our rash articles. Babies can get rashes for many reasons. Most are harmless, but others may need treatment at the clinic. Many babies at this age get chickenpox. It can spread easily and can be very uncomfortable for your baby. But it won't cause any long-term harm.

<body>Your baby's personality is really coming out now. He may be sociable and smile at everyone he meets, or he may be shy and hide his face. 
You don't need to make big plans to lift your spirits and feel refreshed. Try chatting to friends, taking a walk or having a quick lie down. This will give you time to relax and get some energy back.
Now your baby has gotten used to finger foods, try to time his meals so he can join in with the rest of the family. It will mean only one lot of cooking and clearing up for you, and he'll love the experience of eating with everyone. Remember not to add any salt or sugar. It's not healthy for your baby.
It is best to introduce your baby to a variety of foods. This will not only give him a chance to find out what he really likes, but may also encourage him not to be a fussy eater. Try giving him little bits to taste. You will soon find out what he likes!

<body>Your baby's beginning to understand simple words and phrases. Try repeating her words back to her, using adult language. 
Your baby's getting heavier, which means you're more likely to pull a muscle when you carry her. But there are ways to reduce your risk of pain or injury. 
When you lift your baby, always bend your knees. Crouch, rather than bending from your waist. This will protect your back. If you carry your baby on your hip, try not to use the same side each time.
If you do strain yourself, a warm bath or wash can help. You could also try getting some pain relief from the clinic.
You're probably getting better at leaving your baby. She will slowly be learning to be independent. But sometimes, leaving her goes badly and you both end up in tears. Sometimes leaving something that smells of you, such as a t-shirt you have worn helps her to settle. She is reminded of your lovely comforting smell even when you are not there.

When your baby is ill, you may prefer to care for him yourself. You may need to see if you can get time off work to be with your baby. Talk to your employer well in advance so you both know how you will handle the times when your baby is ill. 
Now that your baby is so mobile, your whole home and outside has become his play area. To keep your baby safe and away from germs, check where he goes. Keep him away from water, animals, stools and toilets. This will keep him happy and healthy.

<body>During dinner, you may be amazed as your baby hand-feeds herself an entire meal. Give her a cup and see if she can drink from it without your help. Don't rush her; it may be a few months before she's able to do it. 
Nobody works well when they're tired, but there are plenty of things you can do to refresh yourself. 
A brisk walk can energise your mind and body. Drinking lots of clean water can also help. Try taking a nap, too. A 15-minute sleep while your baby naps can help you get through the afternoon. 
Food is expensive for families. It makes sense to try to save money on it where you can. But eating healthily is important. If meat is expensive, make sure you get plenty of beans, peas and lentils instead. They contain protein which will help you and your baby stay strong. They will also help you to stay fuller for longer.

<body>Your baby now understands simple instructions, though this doesn't mean he'll always listen! To help, use the word "no" rarely.  He'll often forget what you've said, but it's not too early to set boundaries.
Festivals are exciting for children. Starting a family has probably reminded you of how special festivals are. You're probably keen that your baby will have his own store of precious memories. Even if he doesn't understand what's going on, celebrating will give him feelings of security and community. Take care that the excitement doesn't become too much for your baby. Try to take him for quiet breaks away from the noise and activity. 
In just over four weeks' time, you'll be the parent of a one-year-old. You'll want to make his first birthday a special event. Talk to your partner and family about it. Together you can arrange a celebration.

<body>Your baby may now be saying actual words, or making sounds that seem like words. As her brain continues to grow, so does her ability to reason and speak. Listen to her closely and respond to the sounds she makes. This will encourage her.
You and your partner are bound to bring different styles and experiences to parenting. This is a good thing. Having strong opinions means you both care about how your baby behaves. 
If you really disagree, talk about it. This will help you reach a compromise. Agreeing is important if you want your discipline to be effective and to avoid confusing your baby. The best form of discipline is usually the most consistent.
If you and your partner are finding it hard to agree, your partner may think it's easier to just leave it all to you.  But it's best not to let that happen. Your baby needs her carers to have an equal say in her upbringing. So talk about your views and agree on a common solution that you can both follow.

<body>Your baby's first birthday is getting near. However excited you are about it, bear in mind that your baby won't understand the fuss. 
Still, there is no reason not to celebrate!
Keeping the celebration simple will make it more enjoyable for you and your baby.  Hosting it near your home is best. Your baby will feel most comfortable there. Inviting your family and friends will make it special. Try not to invite too many people, though - they may overwhelm your baby.
Your baby is probably still exploring objects by putting them in his mouth. Keep a close eye on him. Make sure there is nothing on the floor that he could pick up that could be harmful. It is also worth thinking about what you put on tables. Your baby may climb onto a chair to get to it. 
When your baby turns one, he may also be able to get a deworming treatment. Worms can be picked up from the ground and can make your baby ill. Ask clinic staff about the treatment and when to get it.

<body>Your baby is eager to please you, so it's never too soon to teach her how to help out. Make tidying up fun by turning it into a game. Break the task into small parts and give her a helping hand.
Food shopping can be expensive. But there are things you can do to save money.
Try going food shopping when someone can watch your baby. Without your baby there, you'll be less distracted. You could also keep a list of foods your family eats often. Stock up when the price is low and buy them in bulk if you can. 
It is a good idea to start putting some money aside for any trips to the clinic in the future. This way, you will always be able to get to the clinic if you need to. 

Your baby may start crying in the middle of the night again. Having a bedtime routine is a good idea, as this can help create good sleep habits. Change your routine if disrupted nights are regular. Perhaps now your baby's older, the routine needs to be adapted.

You can have fun teaching him to walk by standing or kneeling in front of him and holding out your hands. You could also try holding both his hands and walking him towards you. He'll probably take his first steps with his arms out to the side and bent at the elbows. He may also turn out his feet and stick out his bottom for balance.
Almost every mum and dad worries about whether they're a good parent. Trust your instincts, but remember that much of your skill comes from experience and by making a few mistakes. Over time, you will get more confident. Think back over all that you have done so far and be proud - you made it through the first year!
Next week: find out about cleaning your baby's teeth.

<title>1-year-old, first week</title>
<body>Happy birthday, baby! Your first year is over. In the coming months, your toddler will get more independent, explore from an upright position, find her sense of humour and best of all, learn to say she loves you. 
She may have quite a few teeth now. Keep them clean with a small brush with soft bristles and a small smear of toothpaste. Try to use small, circular movements. You may find you get a better view of her mouth if you cradle her on your lap with her head resting in the crook of your arm. Try distracting her while you do this by giving her something to play with.
Your breastmilk has helped your baby grow into a healthy one-year-old. But for some mothers, now is the time to start weaning their baby from their milk. If you are HIV+, talk to staff at the clinic. They will advise you on what is best.
Next week: find out if it is time to introduce other milks besides breastmilk.

<title>1-year-old, second week</title>
<body>Your baby is getting more independent, but he may still not like you leaving him. This is natural. To make this easier, allow plenty of time for goodbyes. This will give him a chance to adjust. It's best to be firm when you leave. 
Now that your toddler is a year old, you can start feeding him some milks other than your breastmilk. It is best to use whole or full-fat milk. This is because he needs the fat for energy. Always use pasteurised or boiled milk. It is safer for your baby.
Try not to give your baby too much milk. If your baby drinks too much, he may get too full to eat anything else. Stick to about two-thirds of a pint a day. Also make sure that your baby eats plenty of solids, especially meat, beans and peas. These will help him grow.

<title>1-year-old, third week</title>
<body>It's exciting when your child forms proper words. Each child will start to do this at a different time. But he still won't be able to say what he wants or how he feels with words. He will rely on gestures for some months yet. He may raise his arms for "up" or point a finger for "What's that?" 
You may also find that he uses one word for many things. A word like "joos" may mean, "I'm thirsty for milk," "No, I want water," or "I dropped my cup!" Listen to the tone. He'll say the same word in different ways using different gestures.
Your toddler's pincer grasp is probably strong now. He can pick up small objects between his thumb and forefinger fairly easily. He may enjoy practising this skill on anything he finds on the floor.
Be extra careful about small things that may fall to the floor. Look out for vitamins and other pills, pieces of food, pins and so on. They could end up in your child's mouth.
Next week: find out why your toddler copies you.

<title>1-year-old, fourth week</title>
<body>Your child is watching everything you do. Toddlers love to copy people around them, especially their parents. It's how they learn basic behaviours.
You may see your child trying to brush her hair or wiping a table with her bib. She'll pick up on your words and speech patterns, too.
But imitation has a downside. Your child may watch you take pills and later, when you're not looking, try to do the same. Store all pills out of reach. 
Worried that your toddler isn't moving on two feet yet? There's no need to. Some children don't walk until they are 16 or 17 months. The 12 month mark is a good time to remember that each child is different. They all develop at their own pace. 
Trust your instincts as a mother and have confidence. Look at your lovely child and remember the journey you have travelled together - from that tiny helpless newborn to the bright and energetic one-year-old. 
Well done for doing such a good job as a mother! Good luck for the future.

<title>How can I prevent my baby getting skin problems?</title>
<body>It's quite common to see rashes and bumps on your baby's skin. Babies can also develop an itchy dry skin condition called eczema. This is because their skin is soft, and can't yet act as a barrier to infections. Sometimes the heat can cause rashes too. 
Baby skin needs extra care, especially in hot and damp weather. There are some things you can do to protect your baby's skin.
Dress your baby in loose cotton clothes. Try not to dress him in fabrics which retain heat. They can be uncomfortable for your baby. They may even give your baby a heat rash.
Keep your baby out of the hot sun. Move him into an airy room or a shady place when the sun is too hot.
A wash with cool water will prevent your baby from getting too hot. Dry him well afterwards.  If you use lotions on your baby, don't use too much, or his skin may become clogged. 
If your baby has itchy dry skin, it could be due to an infection. Take your baby to the clinic. Staff may prescribe a cream.

<title>Why would I need to heat-treat my breastmilk, and how do I do it?</title>
<body>If you are HIV+, heat-treating expressed milk will make your breastmilk extra safe. Follow these instructions on how to heat-treat your milk:
<ul>
<li>Express your milk from both breasts into a clean glass jar or bottle (not plastic), that will not break when you heat it.</li>
<li>Place the uncovered jar of milk in a pan of water. Make sure the water level is above the milk level, so that all the milk is heated.</li>
<li>Heat the water on a very hot fire until the water is boiling.</li>
<li>Remove the jar of milk immediately after the water starts to boil.</li>
<li>Cool the milk until it reaches room temperature - place the milk jar in a container of cool water or let it stand alone to cool. Cover it with a clean cloth, so that dirt or insects don't get into it.</li>
<li>You can safely feed your baby once it is cool.</li>
</ul>
Keep all utensils clean by washing them with clean water and soap.
It's best to express your breastmilk and cup-feed your baby if:
<ul>
<li>your nipples are sore</li>
<li>your baby is too small to suckle</li>
<li>you are trying to wean your baby from breastmilk</li>
</ul>

<title>Now I've had my baby, do I still need to visit the clinic?</title>
<body>Yes. It's best for both you and your baby to visit the clinic regularly.
You need to take your baby to the clinic when he is three days old, then  again when he's six weeks old.  
In the weeks after your baby is born, seeing a health worker is very important. The health worker will check for any signs of illness in your baby. Clinic staff will also check that your baby is growing well. They will be able to monitor your baby and check her growth. 
Staff will also check that you are recovered from the birth. If there is a problem, it will get noticed early. You can then get the treatment you need. 
Throughout the next few years, you may have many questions. Is your baby getting enough milk? Is she healthy? Am I doing everything I should be doing? It's only natural to worry. Keep going for regular check-ups at the clinic. You can get all your questions answered by the staff there.

<title>How can I prepare for visits at the clinic?</title>
<body>You will have been given a 'Road to Health' card by staff at the clinic where you gave birth to your baby. This card will track your baby's growth and development until he is five years old. It will contain information about your child's vaccinations and the supplements taken.
Keep this card safe and bring it with you every time you take your baby to the clinic. Show the card to the doctor or the nurse who attends to you. If someone else takes your baby to the clinic, make sure they bring the card along. 
Prepare for visits by finding out which clinic is nearby. It doesn't have to be the same clinic that you visited during pregnancy. It is also a good idea to start putting some money aside for all your travel to the clinic in the future. This way, you will always be able to get to the clinic if you need to.
If you lose this card, you can get another one at the clinic.

<title>How can I help prevent my baby getting my HIV?</title>
<body>If you are HIV+, you are probably worried about your baby getting HIV too. But there are things you can do to prevent your baby from getting HIV.
Give your baby ONLY breastmilk for the first six months. Breastmilk contains all the nutrients she needs to grow well. It also contains antibodies to fight illnesses. Don't give her different kinds of milk. This will reduce the goodness of breastmilk and increase the risk of HIV passing through the breastmilk. If you are cup-feeding your baby, heat-treating your breastmilk first will make your milk even better.
Your baby needs to take ARV syrup until a month after you wean her from breastmilk. You need to take your ARVs too. ARV helps to increase your baby's ability to fight off HIV.
Your baby will also need to take CTX prophylaxis. This medicine will help protect her from infections.
All these steps will provide your baby with a good chance of a life free from HIV.

<title>I feel sad and don't think I can cope - what should I do?</title>
<body>If you feel tearful, angry and do not enjoy having a baby or you are struggling to cope, you may be depressed. Many mothers feel this way.
Having a baby can be both exciting and exhausting. It can bring much joy, but it can also challenge you in ways you never expected. The reality of parenthood might only just be hitting you now. You will probably find yourself feeling constantly tired, with little time to sleep.  
Talk to your family and friends about how you are feeling. Support and reassurance can make you feel better. If you feel exhausted, ask your family to help. A day or two of rest and sleep will help you cope. Try to nap when your baby sleeps. 
You can also talk to a health worker about how you are feeling. There are medicines that can help. Or call Lifeline at 0117281347.
If you're having financial difficulty looking after your child, check whether you qualify for a child grant at your nearest SASSA office.

<title>How do I prevent my baby from getting pneumonia?</title>
<body>Pneumonia affects many babies. It happens when germs get into their lungs and affects their breathing. Here are some easy ways to prevent your baby from getting pneumonia:
Make sure your baby gets all her vaccinations. Vaccinations will protect her against many types of pneumonia. 
Keep your house clean, to get rid of unhealthy germs and dirt. 
Keep your baby away from stoves and smoke.  Smoke can make your baby weaker and more prone to illnesses.
Make sure your baby eats well. If your baby is less than six months old, she needs ONLY breastmilk. If she is over six months, she will need meat and beans which help her to grow and fight diseases. 

Colourful meals with many vegetables and fruits provide lots of nutrients.  Give her plenty of fluids. 
Take your baby to the clinic if she has:
<ul>
<li>breathing problems</li>
<li>a fever</li>
<li>a cough that gets worse.</li>
</ul>


She will get the right treatment at the clinic. Make sure your baby finishes the full course of treatment to be completely cured.

<title>What vaccinations will my baby need?</title>
<body>Your baby will begin a programme of vaccinations straight after birth. The vaccination programme will protect him against the following infections:
<ul>
<li>tuberculosis</li>
<li>diphtheria</li>
<li>tetanus</li>
<li>whooping cough</li>
<li>polio</li>
<li>haemophilus influenzae type B bacteria, which causes diseases like pneumonia, meningitis and blood poisoning</li>
<li>hepatitis B</li>
<li>pneumococcal infections, such as some forms of pneumonia and meningitis</li>
<li>rotavirus, which causes diarrhoea</li>
<li>measles</li>
</ul>
Vaccines come in several doses. These will be given at various points in your baby's life. Bring your baby to the clinic for a vaccination when he is: 
<ul>
<li>6 weeks old</li>
<li>10 weeks old</li>
<li>14 weeks old</li>
<li>9 months old</li>
<li>18 months old</li>
</ul>
He needs all the doses for full protection. 
Remember to take the 'Road to Health' card with you to the clinic. Staff will record your baby's vaccinations on this card. 
If you wish to be reminded about when to take your baby to the clinic for his vaccinations, check our stage pages.

<title>What should I eat while breastfeeding?</title>
<body>What you eat affects the milk you produce and feed to your baby. So eat well, not just for your health but also for your baby's.

Try to eat two or three extra mouthfuls with every meal or snack that you have.
Try to include whole grains, cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables in your meals every day. 
Make sure you have foods that provide plenty of protein, calcium and iron.  
Protein is important for growth and healing. You can get protein from meat, milk, eggs, lentils, peas and beans.
Calcium is needed for strong bones and teeth. Milk and green leafy vegetables like spinach are good sources of calcium. Fish and eggs will help your body absorb the calcium. 
Meat, lentils and leafy green vegetables have lots of iron. Make sure to include these in your diet. 

Have a glass of lime juice, or eat citrus fruits like oranges. They will help your body absorb the iron.
Drink plenty of water. This will help you keep up your milk supply. Try not to drink too much coffee, tea or alcohol.

<title>When is it a good time to have another baby?</title>
<body>After having a baby, it's best to wait at least two years before you get pregnant again. 
Becoming pregnant earlier than this can put you at risk. Waiting for two years gives your body time to recover from the first birth, and to renew its nutrients for the next time. 
Waiting at least two years keeps your next baby healthy too. By building up your nutrients again, you can make sure your next pregnancy is a healthy one. Getting pregnant too soon can mean that the next baby will be weak, or will be born early.
Waiting at least two years also gives you and your partner time to earn more money. You can use this money to give you and your family the life you deserve, and to save for the future. Many parents even wait three to five years between babies.
Using contraception will help you space your babies. There are many kinds of contraceptives available to prevent getting pregnant.  Condoms, both male and female, will prevent you from getting pregnant and will also help prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Talk to the clinic staff to find out more about contraception.

<title>What contraception should I use?</title>
<body>There are several forms of contraception. You can find one that suits your needs. Staff at the clinic will help you choose one that's best for you.
Condoms are easy to use and easy to get. Condoms also help to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). So they give you double protection.  
The depo provera injection is injected under your skin and protects you from pregnancy for several months. You can have this at your local clinic.
An intrauterine device is a small device that is put into your womb at the clinic. It can be kept for up to ten years, but can be taken out when you want to have more children. 
Only condoms can protect you from STIs.
Ask at the clinic about what options are available in your area.

<title>How can I tell if my baby is ill?</title>
<body>Many baby illnesses are minor, but some can be serious. You will need to take him to the clinic if he has any of these signs:
<ul>
<li>His tummy is too cold or too hot</li>
<li>he develops yellow eyes, hands or feet on the first day of his life</li>
<li>he refuses to feed or sucks poorly</li>
<li>he is vomiting after every feed for more than a day, or has a swollen stomach</li>
<li>he is crying constantly, or his cry sounds unusual</li>
<li>he has a fit, is lethargic, or has bluish skin or nails</li>
<li>he is wheezing, grunting, or breathing quickly</li>
<li>his cord stump is red or smelly, which means it may be infected</li>
</ul>
If your baby has any of these symptoms, take him to the clinic. He may be ill, and could need medical treatment. 
In the meantime, there are things you can do to help ease your baby's distress.
Keep breastfeeding him. Your breastmilk will help him to fight the illness. Let him feed as often as he wants. 
If he has a fever, you can sponge his body with lukewarm water. This will help to bring down the fever. Your baby may be shivering, but don't dress him in extra layers or cover him with blankets. This could make his fever worse.
As a mother, you will probably know if your baby is unwell. If you are at all worried, go to the clinic. The health workers there will check your baby. 
Try to put some money aside, just in case you need to travel to the clinic in an emergency.

<title>The whites of my baby's eyes are yellow - what is this?</title>
<body>If your baby has a yellowish tinge in the whites of the eyes, the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet, then she may have jaundice. Usually, jaundice is not a serious problem. A few days after babies are born, some develop minor jaundice. Jaundice is caused by excess bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is the yellow substance in the blood - it is usually expelled out of the body in urine and stools. 
Your baby's liver is still not quite developed to break down the bilirubin in her blood. If your baby was born full term, it will take 10-14 days for her skin and eye colour to return to normal. It may take a bit longer if she was born early. 
If your baby developed jaundice within the first day of birth, or if her jaundice lasts longer than two weeks, then she will probably need medical treatment. Take her to the clinic.
It's important to breastfeed your baby often. Your breastmilk will help wash out this yellowness. Your baby may be quite sleepy, so you may have to wake her up and encourage her to feed.

<title>How can I keep my baby warm?</title>
<body>Your womb provides a warm and cosy environment for your baby. So when your baby is born he can get cold very easily. You need to make sure he doesn't lose heat. If your baby gets cold, he could become ill.
Skin-to-skin contact is the best way to keep your baby warm as soon as he is born. Once your baby is born, he will be wet. He needs to be dried well and placed naked between your bare breasts. Hold him firmly so he doesn't fall. Your warmth will help keep him warm. Lay a clean, warm cloth over both of you. Ask the midwife to help you. 
Skin-to-skin contact also gives you and your baby time to get to know each other. It will help your baby learn to breastfeed too.
Swaddling your baby will also help to retain heat. Swaddle your baby in a clean cloth and hold him close. This will keep him warm and cosy.  
Babies also lose a lot of heat through their heads. A little hat can help stop this heat loss. Or you could use a cloth wrapper to cover his head.
But make sure he does not overheat. Feel your baby's tummy to check that he's not too hot or too cold.

<title>I am HIV+. How do I stay healthy to look after my baby?</title>
<body>Like many other illnesses, HIV can be controlled and you can lead a happy life. By continuing your care, you can make sure that you remain healthy to look after your baby.
If you are HIV+, you must carry on taking your HIV medicines (ARV). ARVs help you to control your HIV and prevent it from getting worse. ARVs help you live a healthy life. They also prevent HIV spreading to your baby, and add more goodness to your breastmilk.
It is also important to get your CD4 count checked every six months. This will tell you how much your HIV has progressed. Your care and treatment will vary according to your CD4 count. Find out at the clinic where you can have your CD4 count checked. 
If you have any questions about HIV, call the National AIDS helpline on 0800 012 322.

<title>I am HIV+. How long should I breastfeed for?</title>
<body>If you are HIV+, breastfeed your baby till she is one year old. 
The best food for your baby is your breastmilk. Breastmilk carries a lot of goodness that will make your baby stronger.  
For the first six months, give your baby ONLY breastmilk. No other milk or fluids should be given, as this reduces the good effects of breastmilk. 
After six months, she will need to start on solids in addition to the breastmilk. Mashed fruits, vegetables and meat will be best for her tiny stomach. Continue breastfeeding and don't give her any other milk.
Once your baby is a year old, you can start weaning her from breastmilk. Remember to give her nevirapine (ARV syrup) until one month after you stop breastfeeding her. This will prevent her from catching HIV.
If you have any questions about what to feed your baby, talk to a health worker at the clinic, or call the National AIDS helpline at 0800 012 322.

<title>I think my baby may have TB. What do I do?</title>
<body>Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs and can spread to other parts of the body. It is dangerous for babies because their bodies are weaker. They can catch TB if a sick person coughs or sneezes near them.  If your baby has a cough that won't go away, is not gaining any weight, and has a fever, take her to the clinic. The doctor will check if she has TB. 
If she has TB, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. TB can be fully cured if she completes the entire course of antibiotics. Make sure she completes the course, even if she gets better. 
There are some important things you can do to prevent TB: 
<ul>
<li>Make sure she gets the BCG vaccine.</li>
<li>Keep your baby in a clean and healthy environment.</li>
<li>If a family member has TB, make sure they stay away from your baby.</li>
<li>If you have TB, you may need to give your baby medication to prevent your TB passing on to your baby.</li>
</ul>

<title>I have diarrhoea - what should I do?</title>
<body>Diarrhoea is common and is usually caused by bacteria. Washing your hands frequently is the best way to protect yourself from diarrhoea. 
If you have diarrhoea, make sure you: 
<ul>
<li>rest</li>
<li>drink plenty of fluids</li>
<li>eat small, light, balanced meals regularly</li>
<li>include energy giving foods like rice, oats, and wheat in your meals</li>
<li>wash your hands before feeding your baby</li>
</ul>
 It's safe to breastfeed when you have diarrhoea. But be careful about dehydration. Diarrhoea can make you lose a lot of fluids. This can affect your milk supply. You can prevent dehydration by drinking small sips of clean water or fruit juice throughout the day. This will keep you refreshed.
You could also take ORS to replace the fluids you are losing.  ORS contains all the important salts, sugars and minerals that your body needs.  Ask staff at the clinic where you can get ORS.
 Diarrhoea usually only lasts one or two days. But if it lasts longer, visit the clinic. Staff there will be able to give you treatment.

<title>I have lost my appetite - what do I do?</title>
<body>Sometimes you may not feel like eating much. But eating well is important. It gives you the energy you need to take care of your baby. What you eat also affects your breastmilk. 
There are things you can do to make food more appealing. 
Eating with other people can make meal times more enjoyable, so have your meals with your partner or family.
You could also try eating smaller meals often. Eat something small whenever you can. This way you will still be able to get lots of goodness without having to cope with a large meal.
Try eating your favourite foods. Don't worry too much about whether they are healthy or not. Eating a treat is better than not eating at all.
If you are still finding it hard to eat, talk to staff at the clinic. They may be able to give you some treatment to get your appetite back.

<title>I am short of breath, coughing up mucus and have a fever. What is wrong?</title>
<body>A fever, shortness of breath and a cough that brings up mucus could be caused by the flu. But if you are HIV+, you may have a more serious infection such as pneumonia. 
Pneumonia can make you very ill. If you think you have it, go straight to the clinic. You can get the right treatment there. You will probably start feeling better in a couple of days, but you will need to finish all the medicine to make a full recovery. 
There are things you can do to help prevent illnesses like pneumonia. 
If you are HIV+, you can keep yourself strong by taking your medication. This will help you to fight illnesses better.
Smoking or being in a smoke-filled room can make it easier to get pneumonia. If you smoke, try cutting down. If members of your family smoke, ask them to smoke outside. Cooking can make lots of smoke, so try opening doors and windows while preparing food. A smoke-free house will be good for both you and your baby. 
If you have trouble quitting smoking, you can get help and support by calling 0800121314.

<title>When can I feed my baby other milk besides breastmilk?</title>
<body>Your baby will be ready for other milk when he is a year old.
Full fat milk is the best type of milk for him.  Other types such as low fat milks lack the fat, protein and vitamins your baby needs. You can use fresh, pasturised milk, full fat powder milk or evaporated milk. If the milk isn't pasteurised, heat it to a boil and let it cool. This will kill any germs that might make your baby sick.
It's best not to give your baby sweetened, condensed milk or skimmed milk. These milks contain too much sugar and lack the goodness your baby needs. Try not to give your baby too much animal milk every day; 400ml is enough. Too much animal milk will fill your baby up and he may not want to eat anything else. This means that he may not get enough goodness and energy to grow strong.

<title>When can I wean my baby from breastmilk, and how do I do it?</title>
<body>For most mothers, it is best to breastfeed your baby until she is two years old. But if you are HIV+, it may be safer for your baby to be weaned from your breastmilk when she is a year old. 
Whenever you decide to stop breastfeeding, do it gradually following these steps:
<ul>
<li>First, try giving her solid food at mealtimes before you breastfeed her.</li>
<li>Then, do the same before every breastfeed. Your baby will begin to drink less milk, so you will produce less.</li>
<li>Next, start letting her sip on clean water instead of breastmilk.</li>
<li>Finally, slowly reduce the number of breastfeeds you give her, until you stop entirely.</li>
</ul>
If you are HIV+, your baby will need to be weaned over a period of one month. Remember to keep giving her nevirapine (ARV) until a week after you stop breastfeeding her. 
Stopping breastfeeding abruptly can be upsetting for your baby and uncomfortable for you. It could leave you with engorged breasts. It is far better to do it slowly. If you follow the steps mentioned above, your milk supply will slowly reduce. This will be a much more pleasant experience for you both.

<title>How do I care for an early baby?</title>
<body>Most babies are born at the end of the ninth month. But some babies arrive early. They need extra love and care.  
When your baby arrives, he will find it hard to keep warm. You can use your own body heat to stop him getting cold. Hold him naked against your bare chest. You can keep him strapped between your bare breasts using a sling. This will keep him nice and warm. You can also put a hat on his head, as babies lose a lot of heat through their heads. 
You can also help your early baby by breastfeeding soon after birth. The first milk you make is thick and full of goodness. Give your baby this precious gift, so he can grow.  
At first, your baby may not be strong enough to feed at your breast. But you can still feed him by expressing your milk into a clean cup. Gently tilt the cup so that it touches his lower lip and a little milk enters his mouth. Your baby will slowly start lapping the milk. 
Most early babies soon catch up with full-term babies. They just need a bit more of your care!

<title>How do I swaddle my baby?</title>
<body>Here's how to swaddle your baby: 
<ul>
<li>Spread a cotton sheet on a flat surface and fold down a bit of the top right corner.</li>
<li>Lay your baby on her back with her head on the fold.</li>
<li>Pull the corner near your baby's left hand across her body. Tuck the edge under her right arm and around under her back.</li>
<li>Pull the bottom corner up under your baby's chin.</li>
<li>Bring the right-hand corner over and tuck it under her back on the left side.</li>
</ul>
Some babies prefer to have their arms free, so just swaddle your baby under her arms. Keep her face and head uncovered, too. This will let her breathe easily.
Swaddling or snugly wrapping your baby helps make her feel safe and secure. It can stop her being disturbed by the little jerks she makes when she's sleeping. It can also help to settle her down when she's over excited. 
You can swaddle your baby until she is about one month old. After that she will want to move around.

<title>My house is smoky - will it harm my baby?</title>
<body>When babies are exposed to smoke, it can slow down their growth. Their little lungs will find it difficult to breathe. It also increases their risk of getting illnesses like pneumonia, asthma, colds and ear infections.
Having a smoky house will make your baby weaker and more prone to illnesses. So make sure your baby is away from smoke. This includes tobacco smoke, cooking smoke and the smoke that comes from burning rubbish. 
When you are cooking, keep the windows and doors open, so that the smoke leaves the house. Try not to keep your baby in the kitchen.
If your family members smoke, ask them not to smoke in the same room as your baby.  Try to get them to smoke outside your home. Explain why this is better for your baby.
If your little one looks like she is struggling to breathe, or her chest or tummy is sucking in as she breathes, take her to the clinic right away. The staff there will check her to make sure all is well.

<title>What medicine is safe to give my baby?</title>
<body>The safest medicines for your baby is the ones prescribed by clinic staff. 
It is upsetting when your baby is ill. You will want to get him better as quickly as you can.  
Your family and friends may encourage you to go to a traditional healer for help. Or they may ask you to give your baby herbal or traditional medicine. To get your baby happy and healthy again it can be tempting to try these things. But, these cures may not be safe for your baby. They can contain harmful ingredients. 
Getting medicines over the counter without a doctor's prescription is also not a good idea. 
If your baby is ill, you can keep him safe by going straight to the clinic. The staff there will know how to treat your baby safely. They will be able to find out exactly what the problem is and will give your baby the treatment he needs. Explain this to your family, and tell them why going to the clinic is the best option.
So, if your baby has a fever, vomits after eating or has difficulty breathing, don't hesitate.  Go straight to the clinic for help.  By doing this, you will be doing the best thing for your baby.

<title>How can I make my house safe for my baby?</title>
<body>Watching your baby beginning to move around and explore is an exciting time. But it also means that you have to keep a closer eye on her. A mobile baby can reach things which may be dangerous for her. It's important to keep your home safe. 
Look around your home and try to work out what could harm her. Put away cleaning products. Put a barrier in front of the fire or cooker. Cover buckets of water, too. You could also arrange the furniture to block steps or stairs so she cannot fall down them. 
Everyday objects can be dangerous for babies. Bleach, paint, cigarettes, alcohol, and medicine meant for adults are all poisonous for a baby.  Knives, glass and scissors will need to be kept out of reach.  A locked cupboard is ideal.
Once your baby is confident at crawling she may also begin climbing up on the furniture. A tumble from a chair onto a hard floor can be very painful, so keep an eye on her all the time. This stage is often very tiring for the parents, but great fun for the baby!

<title>What are worms and how can I protect my baby?</title>
<body>Worms are parasites that live inside the body. You can get them from infected mud and soil. They can cause stomach pain, coughing and fever. 
When your baby starts crawling, she will want to explore. You need to make sure that she plays somewhere clean to keep worms away.
Here are some tips on how you can help protect your baby from worms:
<ul>
<li>Keep your baby away from unclean water.</li>
<li>Keep her away from animals and their stools.  Your baby may love playing with animals, but they are dirty. Wash her hands well with soap and clean water after she strokes them.</li>
<li>Keep your baby away from latrines.</li>
<li>Keep the floor clean. Try to clean the floor with soap and water before your baby plays there. If you cannot clean the floor, lay down a large, clean blanket.</li>
<li>Keep her feet covered. When your baby starts walking, it's best that she wears shoes or thick socks when she goes out.</li>
</ul>
When your baby turns one, she can get deworming treatment. This will get rid of any worms that she has picked up. You can find out more at the clinic.

<title>How do I register my baby's birth?</title>
<body>Time goes quickly when you have a newborn to look after, but you need to remember to register your baby. Do this before he is 30 days old. When you register your baby you will get an abridged birth certificate free of charge.
To register, you need to:
Fill out form DHA-24 mentioning your baby's gender, name and surname. You can get the form at the nearest Department of Home Affairs office. Submit the filled out form at the nearest Home Affairs office. Bring your identity documents, marriage certificate and your child's clinic card with you when you submit the form.
If you register your child any later than 30 days after birth, then you will need to explain why your baby's birth wasn't registered earlier.
Registering your baby is important as it acts as proof your baby's existence. And it's completely free.
You can also get a child grant from the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). Find out if you qualify at the nearest SASSA office.

<title>Breastfeeding help</title>
<body>As a new mother, there is a lot to learn. Breastfeeding is something you and your baby learn how to do together. Babies are born ready to breastfeed and your body has been getting ready to feed your baby throughout pregnancy.
Problems such as sore nipples or over full breasts can be solved with the right help. You may find that friends who are breastfeeding have good tips to offer.  Just watching how a friend and her baby feed can give you ideas about how to feed your own baby. The practical and emotional support of your family is important as well. 
Your baby's breastfeeding needs will change as he grows, so what seems to be a problem one day can be easy the next day. And every day you breastfeed your baby, you will become more confident. 
If you run into problems you can get help from the staff at the clinic. Or you can ring the Breastfeeding Association on 021 686 8363 during work hours. They can guide you.

<title>Why should I breastfeed?</title>
<body>Breastfeeding is one of the best things you can do for your baby. Your milk has all the fats, vitamins and minerals he needs to grow and be protected against disease. A baby who has breastmilk gets sick much less than other babies. It also helps him recover faster when he does get ill! 
Your body knows exactly how to care for your baby. As your baby grows, the milk you make will change to suit him. Your body will also make the right amount of milk for your baby. If you keep breastfeeding, your baby will always have what he needs. 

Breastfeeding also acts as a type of contraception. By feeding your baby only breastmilk for six months, you can help to delay your period. This only works if you breastfeed whenever your baby wishes, during the day and night. And if you don't feed him anything else.  
Your milk is perfect for your baby. So give him the best start in life by breastfeeding.

<title>My baby is crying and bringing up milk - has she got reflux or an allergy?</title>
<body>It is very rare for a baby to be allergic to her mother's milk. Your milk is designed for your baby.
If your baby has been bringing up milk after feeds, or has been vomiting, it may look as though she is allergic to your milk. But these are more likely to be signs of reflux, not an allergic reaction. 
Babies get reflux because the muscle at the end of the food pipe, which keeps food in the tummy, isn't fully grown yet. This means that when your baby's tummy is full, food and acid can come back up. This can cause her to bring up a bit of milk. If the reflux is severe, she may even vomit. She may also cry after feeding because the end of the food pipe is sore. 
 You do not have to stop breastfeeding. Try giving your baby smaller, more frequent feeds. Hold her sitting upright for twenty minutes after a feed to allow time for her to begin to digest the milk. 
Most babies with reflux grow out of it quite quickly as the muscle at the end of the food pipe gets stronger.  
If a baby has a true allergic reaction to milk, she will be flushed, have watery eyes, a stuffy nose and may also have a rash.
 If your baby is not showing these signs, she is very unlikely to be allergic to your milk. If you are worried, don't stop breastfeeding until you have spoken to clinic staff.

<title>How do I take care of my baby's cord?</title>
<body>Now that your baby is here he will need extra special care. The umbilical cord can get infected easily, but by following these tips you can help to keep your newborn healthy.
<ul>
<li>Clean the cord in a warm room and dry your baby quickly so he doesn't get cold.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with clean water and soap before touching the cord.</li>
<li>Clean it by sponging it with surgical spirits or meths and nothing else. Ask for them at the clinic.</li>
<li>After cleaning the cord leave it uncovered.  Let the air dry it. If it's moist it is easier for an infection to start.  If you must dress the cord just cover it loosely with a clean cloth.  Change this often.</li>
</ul>
Your baby's cord will take between 5 and 15 days to dry out, become black and fall off.  This will happen naturally.  Once the cord has gone, it will take about 10 days for the belly button to heal.  Keep the belly button clean.
The belly button may have a little pus or blood once the cord has gone.  But if it is moist, smelly, red or swollen, it may be infected.  The clinic will be able to treat it.

<title>My baby is HIV+. What do I do now?</title>
<body>Your baby will be tested for HIV at 6 weeks. Getting this test is better than not knowing. It means that if your baby needs treatment, she can get it. If you find out that your baby is HIV+, there are things you can do to control it. You can give your baby a fighting chance to stay well and healthy.  
First, get your baby started on ARV syrup to make sure that the HIV does not progress. 
Your baby will also need to start CTX prophylaxis as soon as she can. This comes as syrup and as a pill. The prophylaxis will protect your baby against infections, particularly a form of pneumonia. Along with all her vaccinations, the treatment will keep her well-shielded against illnesses.
Continue breastfeeding for as long as possible. Your breastmilk will provide protection against many infections and will help your baby grow healthily.

If your baby is older than six months, make sure you feed her meat, fruits and vegetables along with breastmilk. This will help your baby grow strong and healthy.
If you want more information call the National AIDS helpline at 0800 012 322.

<title>How do I know if my baby is growing well?</title>
<body>It is easy to tell if your baby is growing well.  A healthy, growing baby will get steadily heavier and stronger.  You should find that he gets harder to lift each month!
A baby with a good appetite, who suckles at the breast six to eight times a day, is another good sign. He should also be active and responsive, too.  
If you think your baby is not getting heavier and stronger, take him to the clinic. You should also take him to the clinic if he is not sucking well at the breast, or has difficulty breathing. These are signs that your baby is not well and needs treatment at the clinic.  
Even if your baby is growing well, visiting the clinic often is important.  At the clinic, the staff will weigh and measure your baby, to check that he is growing well. If your baby is not growing well, staff will help you find out what is wrong.
To help your baby grow, keep breastfeeding your baby whenever he seems hungry. Don't give him any other food or liquid until he is six months old. This will help him to grow strong and healthy.

<title>It burns when I urinate - what can I do?</title>
<body>If it is painful when you urinate, you might have a bladder infection. It is best to go to the clinic. A bladder infection can be cured easily with antibiotics. Make sure you take all the medicine. Otherwise, the infection can come back. If left untreated, the infection could harm your kidneys.
Other signs of a bladder infection are:
<ul>
<li>a fever</li>
<li>feeling suddenly hot and cold </li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>pain during sex</li>
<li>blood in your urine</li>
</ul>
You can prevent bladder infections if you: 
<ul>
<li>Wear cotton underwear which isn't too tight.</li>
<li>Urinate as soon as you feel the need to, instead of waiting.</li>
<li>Wipe from 'front' to 'back' after using the toilet.</li>
<li>Urinate after sex if you can. Wash your private parts with gentle soap before and after having sex too.</li>
<li>Drink lots of clean boiled water.</li>
</ul>

<title>What are measles, and how can I prevent my baby from catching them?</title>
<body>Measles is a serious illness. It is spread through coughs and sneezes. If your baby comes into contact with someone with measles, she can catch it.  
You can protect your baby from measles by getting her vaccinated. Your baby will be able to get the first dose of the vaccine at nine months, and another dose at 18 months. You can get it at the clinic.
You can also help to keep your baby safe by knowing the signs of measles. This way if she does catch it, you will be able to get treatment for her quickly.
The signs of measles are similar to a cold.  A baby with measles will have a fever, runny nose, sore throat and a cough.  After a few days the baby may have rashes on her face and neck, too.  Measles rashes are blotchy and red.  
If you see any of these signs in your baby, take her to the clinic straight away.  Staff there will give her the treatment she needs.

<title>What is cerebal palsy?</title>
<body>Cerebral palsy is a condition which affects body movement and posture.  It can cause a baby's hands to shake, and uncontrolled body movements. It is caused by brain damage. The brain damage usually happens before, during or just after birth. This may be due to an infection or a lack of oxygen. Sometimes, no cause can be found.
Most children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed in the first year of their life. 
Sadly, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. If your child has cerebral palsy, he will be given treatment to ease the symptoms and help him feel better. He may also be given physiotherapy. Physiotherapy will help teach your child how to control his head movements and sit, roll over, crawl and walk. 
A physiotherapist will help you to feed, carry and dress your child without damaging his muscles.  Speech therapy can also help if your child has difficulty swallowing or chewing. 
It is not your fault if your child has cerebral palsy.

You can get more information about cerebral palsy from KnowCP at 041 583 2130

<title>Why does my baby need Vitamin A?</title>
<body>Your baby needs many vitamins to help him grow. Each vitamin will help his body in a different way. Vitamin A is important for your baby's eye development. It also gives him healthy skin, bones and blood. 
For the first six months of your baby's life, he will need nothing but your breastmilk. Breastmilk will give him all the nutrients he needs, including Vitamin A. 
After six months, your baby will need extra vitamins. He can get them by eating solid food, along with breastmilk. Fruit and vegetables are the main foods containing Vitamin A. Why don't you give him simple foods such as a baked sweet potato, a raw carrot or some melon? They all have vitamin A in them. 
To keep your baby healthy, he will also need meat, fish, beans or lentils. These foods will give him strength. Try to give him some of these foods with each meal. 
Staff at the clinic may have Vitamin A tablets that you could give your baby. They will give him an extra boost. Ask at the clinic whether your baby needs them.

<title>Should I discipline my baby?</title>
<body>By nine months, you may notice your baby is starting to test your authority!  She will want to find out what she can and can't do, and what your reaction will be. She is not being naughty - she is just curious! 
Your baby is not old enough to understand the difference between right and wrong. There is no point disciplining her, because she cannot remember things for long.  This means that your baby may repeatedly do something which you have told her not to do. Teaching your baby what she can and can't do will take time. It can be stressful if you think she is just being naughty. If you understand that it takes her time to learn things will be much easier.
Before you react, take a few deep breaths. Tell your baby 'no' in a firm voice. You can then try distracting her with a toy or activity. 
To teach your baby right from wrong, praise and reward her good behaviour.  When she behaves well, give her plenty of cuddles and kisses. She will gradually learn that good behaviour gets a more pleasant response from you!

<title>How can I cope with stress?</title>
<body>Having a baby is exciting and challenging. But that doesn't mean it's not stressful. You probably have had to make lots of changes to your life. You may feel tired and worried. Many mothers experience this. 
There are some easy ways to help you feel more in control. Try to make some time for yourself to rest. Not getting enough sleep can make the simplest tasks difficult.  Fit your sleeping around your baby's naps. This will help keep you rested. 
Eating healthily can help to relieve stress. Your baby will benefit from this, too. She'll be getting all her nutrition from you. Try to eat three meals a day. And have some nice snacks throughout the day, too. Fruit and vegetables are healthy and make good, quick snacks. 
Sometimes all you need is to talk to somebody you trust. Why not try talking to your partner, or your friend? Sharing work and stress with others can also help you to relax.

<title>I think my baby is dehydrated - what should I do?</title>
<body>Babies can get dehydrated when they lose too much liquid.  Getting too hot, having diarrhoea, a fever or vomiting can all cause your baby to lose fluids.
If your baby is dehydrated, there are things you can do to treat it. 
If your baby is less than six months old, breastfeed him often. If he's older than six months, give him extra sips of clean water. 
You can also give a baby over six months ORS. ORS is a special mixture containing one litre of cool boiled water, six teaspoons of sugar and a pinch of salt.  You can make it yourself or get it from the clinic. ORS helps your baby to replace all the salts, sugar and liquid he has lost. Give him sips of ORS a few times an hour, with his breastmilk.
Don't give your baby sweet drinks, or put anything in his bottom. This could make your baby ill.
You can check if your baby is dehydrated by pinching the skin on his tummy. It should be springy. If the skin moves back slowly, then he is dehydrated. If your baby still seems to be dehydrated after you have tried the methods above, take him to the clinic. Staff there will be able to help.

<title>My baby is ready for solids - what should I feed him?</title>
<body>If your baby is six months old, he will be ready to start eating solids as well as being breastfed.  
You may be wondering what to feed him.  He has a tiny tummy, so he will only need tiny amounts of food at first. 
Fruits and vegetables are good first foods for babies, because they contain lots of vitamins and nutrients.  
Soft and ripe fruits like banana, mango and pear are good to start with. Mash them well. Also mash cooked and washed vegetables, such as carrots or sweet potatoes.  
You can also try feeding your baby mielie meal. After you make it, stir in a spoonful of peanut butter or margarine. Add some of your breastmilk too, but do not use not cow's milk. You can also add vegetables like mashed carrot and potato. When it is ready, strain it through a sieve to make it smooth. If your baby is older than nine months, you can even add in an egg while it's cooking.
Iron-rich foods are also good to feed to your baby. Iron helps your baby become stronger.  Mash meat, chickpeas, beans or lentils.  They all contain lots of iron.

<title>I don't have clean drinking water - what can I do?</title>
<body>Most tap water is clean and safe to drink. But if you live in an area where there is no tap water, or the tap water isn't clean, drinking this water could spread diseases which cause diarrhoea and stomach flu. 

There are simple things you can do to make the water safe to drink. 

Pour the water through a clean cotton cloth, and then boil it. Boiling gets rid of any germs or dirt in the water.  Allow the water to cool before you drink it. Keep the pan of water covered with a clean cloth or piece of newspaper. This will stop flies and dirt getting into it. Perhaps boil up a large bucket for the day, so that you only have to prepare the water once. 

If you cannot boil water, you can bleach it to make it safe. Put one teaspoon of bleach into 250ml of water. Mix it, then leave it for at least two hours. Do not stir it, and make sure you keep it covered.

Buying bottled water is usually clean and safe. Always check that the seal on the bottle is not broken. A broken seal means the water has been opened before. It could have been refilled with dirty water.

<title>Is my baby healthy?</title>
<body>Every mother wants to know that her baby is doing well. Here are three simple ways to check that your baby is healthy.  
If your baby is eating well and putting on weight, she is well. You can be proud of this - it is your milk that is making her grow so big and strong. An ill baby will not feed well and will not grow bigger. 
Her personality and her playful nature are all signs she's doing well. She's probably enjoying playing games with you, and is happy to see people she knows. These are all signs your baby is well and happy. An ill baby will be sleepy and won't want to play. 
If your little one is sleeping well, this is another sign of a healthy baby. Babies who are ill often keep waking up, and cry a lot. 
If you feel that your baby is not well, trust your instincts. Get her checked by the staff at the clinic. It will give you peace of mind.

<title>How can I get more sleep?</title>
<body>Having trouble sleeping? Getting through the day with little sleep and no energy is tough, especially with a young baby to look after. Here are some tips to stay rested. 
Try to sleep when your baby sleeps. A nap during the day will give you an energy boost. Making a night time routine for your baby will also help. You could sing a lullaby to your baby before you put him to bed, or you could give him a bath, too. The important thing is that you do the same thing every night, in the same order. This routine will tell your baby that it is time for sleep. 
Try not to eat just before you go to sleep. It makes it harder to get to sleep. Eat a light meal a few hours before going to bed. This will help you feel calm and comfortable. 
Getting to sleep can be difficult if you're feeling uncomfortable and hot. Wear comfortable, loose clothing. This will keep you cool. If mosquitoes bother you at night, sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net. If this makes you too hot, take some of your clothes off to cool down.

<title>Why is mixed feeding harmful?</title>
<body>Mixed feeding is harmful for your baby, because she would be getting less of your precious breastmilk. If you are HIV+, mixed feeding will make it easier for HIV to pass on to your baby through your breastmilk. Other milk can damage your baby's gut, allowing the virus to pass through. Feeding only breastmilk until she is six months old will help prevent this.
Any other milk, like cow's milk or formula milk, will not have the rich goodness of breastmilk. Breastmilk contains lots of nutrients and antibodies to help your baby fight illnesses. Drinking different kinds of milk reduces the goodness of breastmilk.
Other forms of milk can pick up germs easily. This increases your baby's risk of infection. Your little baby will then find it hard to fight the germs. Breastmilk, however, comes straight from your breast. This means that your baby is much less likely to come into contact with germs. 
Keep your baby strong and healthy - don't feed her anything else until she is six months old.

<title>How can I keep my baby's food safe?</title>
<body>After six months, your baby will be ready for solids. Your baby is growing up! This means that you will have to store and cook his food carefully. Your baby has a delicate stomach, and keeping his food safe will prevent him from getting diarrhoea.
Here are some ways you can keep your baby's food safe:
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap before you begin cooking or washing food.</li>
<li>Wash your baby's food in clean water before it is cooked. Dirt contains lots of germs which can harm your baby.  Feed your baby only fresh food.  Food that has been left out in the sun, or that was cooked a while ago can be full of germs.</li>
<li>Make sure that all your baby's food is well cooked.  Food that is not cooked fully still contains germs.  Cook food well to kill those germs. Check that meat is not pink in the middle, and fish is cooked until it flakes apart.  Cook eggs until they are firm.</li>
<li>Wash your baby's hands with soap before he eats if he can touch his food.</li>
</ul>
By simply following these tips, you can easily keep your baby's food safe.
