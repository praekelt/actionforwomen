		        <h2>MAMA SA welcomes it's 200,000th user!</h2>
		        <img src="img/mama_user.jpg" />
		        <p>There is excitement in the Praekelt Foundation <a href="http://www.askmama.co.za/">MAMA South Africa</a> camp. They are watching MAMA’s user numbers climb. They’ve used up all their fingers and are still counting. Growth, it seems, is relentless. Just over a month ago MAMA content was released on <em>Vodafone Live!</em> and already 175,983 additional mothers are actively accessing MAMA information via this channel. At this rate, combined with steady user growth on <em>Vodafone Live!</em>, MAMA has now reached 200,000 users on 9 October - sharing relevant maternal and child-health information that can improve wellbeing for South African mothers and their families. So join us in welcoming MAMA SA’s 200,000th user!</p>
		        <p><a href="http://www.mobilemamaalliance.org/">MAMA</a> – the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action launched in the US in 2010 with the aim to use mobile technology to support new moms and pregnant women in 3 implementation countries: Bangladesh, South Africa and India.  The three countries were chosen as implementation sites for MAMA, for good and bad reasons:  “Good” stems from the fact that in these countries, mobile penetration is at record highs and are still growing  - making mobile technologies the opportune way in which to reach moms with life-saving information. The “Bad” refers to unacceptable high rates of maternal and child mortality and the challenge of meeting MDGs 4 and 5 seems to be slipping out of reach….</p>
		        <p>MAMA South Africa officially launched in the lead-up to Mother’s Day, in May 2013.  MAMA South Africa uses mobile to inform and empower mothers to adopt healthy behaviours and encourages them to access maternal and child health services and information.</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>This includes advice, resources and information that encourages early antenatal care, assists mothers in understanding how to prevent HIV transmission to their babies, and promotes exclusive breastfeeding for all mothers.  MAMA leverages a variety of platforms and channels, because the point is not to give moms something new, but to reach them where they are, right now.</p>
		        <p>With its unique, multi-channel approach and focus on local issues like HIV during pregnancy, South African mothers are seeing the value of signing up to MAMA. Channels and methods that have not have been harnessed globally (e.g. a Mobi site and an Interactive Quiz system), have proved immensely popular in the local context. Of course, Praekelt Foundation is no stranger to using mobile to power community change in ways that can be scaled up. In fact, high user numbers for any Foundation project are a must-have. Even so, the Foundation’s Marcha Bekker says that the speed of growth on MAMA has exceeded the team’s expectations, particularly the users coming from the Vodafone Live! platform. Says Marcha: <em>“We are extremely excited about our strong partnership with Vodacom and that they have seen the value of MAMA content and are now offering this content to their Vodafone Live! users - free of charge. The levels of engagement and repeat-visitors we see, are testimony to the fact that their customers find the MAMA content useful and helpful”</em></p>
		        <p>Says Maya Makanjee, Chief Officer: Corporate Affairs: <em>“Vodacom is encouraged by the phenomenal increase in MAMA users on the Vodafone Live! platform.  This confirms our belief that a mobile phone can be used very successfully in the delivery of critical maternal health information, helping reduce maternal and child mortality incidents.</em></p>
		        <p>South Africa’s expectant and new moms can currently benefit from MAMA in one of four ways:</p>
		        <ol>
		            <li>Vodacom customers can access MAMA mobi content from Vodafone Live!, under “More Menu’s” and “Health and Lifestyle”, or simply go to <a target="_blank" href="http://live.vodafone.com/mama">live.vodafone.com/mama</a> (Free to Vodacom customers)</li>
		            <li>Non-Vodacom customers can access the MAMA mobi content by visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.askmama.mobi/">www.askmama.mobi</a> from their Internet-enabled mobile phone. (Normal data charges apply)</li>
		            <li>To sign up for SMSs from MAMA which is tied to your stage of pregnancy or your baby’s age, dial *120*2112*1# (cost 20c per 20 seconds) and sign yourself up.</li>
		            <li>To access a weekly, informational quiz - also tied to your stage of pregnancy or your baby’s age, dial *120*2112# to register, and re-dial the same number every “MAMA Monday” for your weekly quiz (cost 20c per 20 seconds)</li>
		        </ol>
		        <p>A fifth service, MAMA on Mxit, will launch soon and will bring the MAMA content to moms on the MXit platform.</p>
		        <p>The final say, around the impact that MAMA has had on the lives of South African moms, should undoubtedly go to a MAMA user: <em>“This MAMA is giving us (information about) nutritious diet (and about) which veg or fruit to take during pregnancy time or trying time, so follow it”</em></p>
